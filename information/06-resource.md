## Plan your 12 hours 

This is a 4 credit course. In general, you should plan to spend a minimum of 3 hours for each credit hour per week. I believe that it would be helpful for you to develop a weekly schedule for how you want to spend these 12 hours. Keep track of the time you spend, and reach out to help if you are spend significantly more time than planned. 

A sample plan could be 

1. Attending lecture 1.5 hrs 
2. Attending Lab  2 hr 
3. Reading and quiz: 1.5-2 hr
4. Homework/project: 6-8 hr 
5. Attending office hours/ communication: 0.5-1 hr
