|F	|0-59|

### Late Policy 
Unless you have made an arrangement with the intructor <mark>PRIOR </mark> to a submission deadline, late works are not accepted. We will not give late excuses or make-up assignment. 

### Reading and Quiz
This class use a [flipped classroom model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom#:~:text=A%20flipped%20classroom%20is%20an,problem%2Dsolving%20during%20class%20time.), where you will learn the core concepts through readings and online lecture watching. After the reading/online lecture, you should be able to complete the homework set. <strong>It is crucial for you to complete these readings/videos BEFORE your lab sessions </strong>. All reading materials will be released on or before the Friday prior to the new week. On the following Monday, a quiz regarding the reading material will due at <strong>10 pm (instead of midnight)</strong>.   

You will complete all quizzes electronically on Canvas. You will receive immediate feedback as to the correctness of answers. You may repeat questions that they do not get correct (see Canvas for more detail). 


### Homework  
Each homework set will contain tasks from one or more of these 3 different topics: 
1. Pure Python Section 
2. Maya Section 
3. Bonus/Open-ended Challenges 


For each section, you will write script in one python script file and submit them. e.g., you will submit the following file for HW1
-   hw1_p.py
- hw1_m.py
- hw1_b.py  (OPTIONAL)


In addition to producing these scripts, we also ask you to complete an answersheet each week. The answer sheet is simple document where you will write responses and paste screenshots for the output of your program.  You will complete the document, export it into PDF, and upload to Canvas along with your scripts. 

Therefore, for each homework set, you will upload 3 files (4 if you have completed the bonus challenge) to Canvas.  
- hw1_p.py
- hw1_m.py
- hw1_b.py (OPTIONAL)
- hw1_answer_sheet.pdf

Please refer to the canvas page for more submission details.

Homework sets will be released on Monday. They are due the next Tuesday at <strong>10 pm (instead of midnight)</strong>. After the submission deadline, you will be assigned to peer review a submission by Thursday 10pm. 

We will try to grade as soon as we can.  Please allow 1-2 weeks to receive the grading. 


### Final Project (Optional) 
The final project is a creative open-ended project. It will require you leverage most of the concept and techniques we teach in this semester.  We will release the detail of the final project on or before 4/15. You will have 3-4 weeks to complete the project. The final project counts for 4% of the your grade.

## Course Policies

### COVID-19 Addendum to Syllabus
Campus Safety Measures

To promote public safety and protect students, faculty, and staff during the coronavirus pandemic, Texas A&M University has adopted policies and practices for the Spring 2021 academic term to limit virus transmission. Students must observe the following practices while participating in face-to-face courses and course-related activities (office hours, help sessions, transitioning to and between classes, study spaces, academic services, etc.):

Self-monitoring—Students should follow CDC recommendations for self-monitoring. Students who have a fever or exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 should participate in class remotely if that option is available, and should not participate in face-to-face instruction.
Face Coverings—Face coverings (cloth face covering, surgical mask, etc.) must be properly worn in all non-private spaces including classrooms, teaching laboratories, common spaces such as lobbies and hallways, public study spaces, libraries, academic resource and support offices, and outdoor spaces where 6 feet of physical distancing is difficult to reliably maintain. Description of face coverings and additional guidance are provided in the Face Covering policy and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) available on the Provost website.

Physical Distancing—Physical distancing must be maintained between students, instructors, and others in course and course-related activities.

Classroom Ingress/Egress—Students must follow marked pathways for entering and exiting classrooms and other teaching spaces. Leave classrooms promptly after course activities have concluded. Do not congregate in hallways and maintain 6-foot physical distancing when waiting to enter classrooms and other instructional spaces.

To attend a face-to-face class, students must properly wear an approved face covering If a student refuses to wear a face covering, the instructor should ask the student to leave and join the class remotely. If the student does not leave the class, the faculty member should report that student to the Student Conduct office for sanctions. Additionally, the faculty member may choose to teach that day’s class remotely for all students, or dismiss the class in the case of a traditional face to face lecture.

PLEASE NOTE that general communications regarding COVID policies, and how these will impact spring semester teaching, will be regularly updated on the following website: www.tamu.edu/coronavirus/index.html. Any information specific to COVID response and management in classrooms will be shared in additional email communications.

### Attendance
Attendance will not be taken in the lecture sessions or the lab sessions of this course. However, if you miss a class, you must first consult with a classmate about missed material prior to seeking assistance from the TAs or instructors. It is your responsibility to be familiar with material presented and discussed in class.

Attendance will not be taken in laboratory sessions, however, these labs will provide you hands-on coding help and immediate feedback. If you miss the lab, it is your responsibility to be familiar with material presented in the lab sessions. Part of the lab tasks will be graded during lab. If you miss the lab you will also miss the opportunities to get these parts graded. 

### Late Class Policy
Your instructors will make every effort to be in class on time, or to inform you of any delay or cancellation. In the unusual event that they should not arrive in class or send word by 10 minutes from the class start time, the class is officially cancelled.

### Class Cancellation Policy
In case a scheduled class meeting is cancelled due to circumstances beyond our control, any scheduled work that is affected will be rescheduled, as announced by your instructors.

### Laptop and Mobile Device Policy
Please silence your mobile devices before class. Do not text or play games during class.  Please exercise good judgment since you may not only distract yourself, but also people seated near you. If you use your laptop or mobile device in such a way that it distracts others (e.g. playing games), you will be asked to leave.

### Recording Devices
Lectures and Q&A sessions may not be recorded without the written permission of the instructor and you do not have the instructor’s permission to use notes from lectures for commercial lecture note purposes.

### Collaboration Yes, Plagiarism No
In this course, we want to encourage collaboration and the free interchange of ideas among students and in particular the discussion of Programming Challenges, approaches to solving them, etc. However, we do not allow plagiarism, which, as commonly defined, consists of passing off as one's own ideas words, writings, etc., which belong to another. In accordance with this definition, you are committing plagiarism if you copy the work of another person and turn it in, unacknowledged, as your own, even if you should have the permission of that person. Plagiarism is one of the worst academic sins, for the plagiarist destroys the trust among colleagues without which research cannot be safely communicated.

### Copyright
The materials provided in this course are copyrighted. They are intended for use only by students registered and enrolled in this course and only for instructional activities associated with and for the duration of the course. They may not be retained in another medium or disseminated further.

### University Policies
#### Attendance Policy
The university views class attendance and participation as an individual student responsibility. Students are expected to attend class and to complete all assignments.

Please refer to Student Rule 7 in its entirety for information about excused absences, including definitions, and related documentation and timelines.

### Makeup Work Policy
Students will be excused from attending class on the day of a graded activity or when attendance contributes to a student’s grade, for the reasons stated in Student Rule 7, or other reason deemed appropriate by the instructor.

Please refer to Student Rule 7 in its entirety for information about makeup work, including definitions, and related documentation and timelines.

Absences related to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 may necessitate a period of more than 30 days for make-up work, and the timeframe for make-up work should be agreed upon by the student and instructor” (Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.1).

“The instructor is under no obligation to provide an opportunity for the student to make up work missed because of an unexcused absence” (Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.2).

Students who request an excused absence are expected to uphold the Aggie Honor Code and Student Conduct Code. (See Student Rule 24.)

Academic Integrity Statement and Policy
“An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do.”

“Texas A&M University students are responsible for authenticating all work submitted to an instructor. If asked, students must be able to produce proof that the item submitted is indeed the work of that student. Students must keep appropriate records at all times. The inability to authenticate one’s work, should the instructor request it, may be sufficient grounds to initiate an academic misconduct case” (Section 20.1.2.3, Student Rule 20).
