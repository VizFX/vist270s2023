## Part 1: 3D Tree Sculpture [( video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZs7B8kJUt8):  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 6.5%  </span>

### Task 1.1 Generate One Branch by with curve and loft<span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span>
Initiate a class `Branch` that would generate a branch-like shape in Maya. We will create the branch structure by drawing a group of stacked polygons.

Then, we connect the stacked polygons into a shape using `loft`.

### Task 1.2 Add noise  to create texture  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>
Add noise to each polygon (side ct, vertex locations, and gaps between each polygon). 

After adding the noise, you will have outputs similar to this

### Task 1.3 Create a tree with for loops  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1.5% </span>
Write a for loop that generates a list `Branch` instances and visualize it 

Your result will look similar to the following image

### Task 1.4 Create a tree with recursive function <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 2.5% </span>
Implement a function so that you can generate the branches recursively. Each branch is building on top its parent settings.

### Task 1.5 Decorate the tree with additional features <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1% </span>
Modify the tree generator with your own creative elements. Add at least one additional feature to your tree generator. For example adding leaf, adjust parameter/rendering to make unconventional trees, or adding decorations on the tree.

Describe the feature you added on the answer sheet. 

Bonus: If we love your additional features, you will get 0.1-0.5% bonus.
