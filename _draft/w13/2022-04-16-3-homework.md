## Overview
The homework set counts for <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 6.5%  </span> of your total grade. This homework only contains one part, and you will be using Maya for the entire homework. The video for this week will be longer than normal as well. Your TA will check off 1.1-1.2 during the lab.

## Part 1: 3D Sculpture [( video)](https://youtu.be/X3RJRqYn_Xo):  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 6.5%  </span>
Today we are generating a base of a creature in Maya. This simplified and abstracted creature will have a body (which can also serve as a head), arms, and legs. We will generate these features using curves.   

For example, this will be one of the outputs you can get from this generator.

We will build our generator based on the code we developed in the past. Including 

- [Brush.py](https://github.com/LiciaHe/vist270s2022/tree/master/assets/w14/Brush.py)
- [ParametricGenerator.py](https://github.com/LiciaHe/vist270s2022/tree/master/assets/w14/ParametricGenerator.py)
- [CubicBezierGenerator.py](https://github.com/LiciaHe/vist270s2022/tree/master/assets/w14/CubicBezierGenerator.py)
- [utility.py](https://github.com/LiciaHe/vist270s2022/tree/master/assets/w14/utility.py)


### Task 1.1 Generate a base<span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span>

Create a new Creature class that inherits the Brush class. We will generate the base of the creature using curves. 

Write a method that generates a curve. You create the curve on any plane you like. For example, this is a curve generated on the x-y plane. 

![](../../../assets/w14/Pasted image 20220417133240.png) 

Revolve the curve to form a geometry. You will use the [revolve](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2022/ENU/index.html?guid=__CommandsPython_revolve_html) command. Make sure the axis you are revolving around is set according to where your curve is. Add randomness into the curve so that you can get different base designs.

### Task 1.2 Generate a curve for arm<span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span>
Write another method to generate the arms of the creature. The arm-generating process can be summarized in 4 steps. This task covers the first two steps. 

1. Create a curve that starts on the base shape, and ends outside of the base.

3. Create a shape (circle, rectangle, or any other flat shape) at the start of the curve

### Task 1.3 Create arms through extrusion <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span>

Finish the arm generating method by completing the following steps: 

1. Extrude the shape along the curve to form the geometry. You will use the [extrude](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2022/ENU/index.html?guid=__Commands_extrude_html) command.

2. Reflect the arm design with the x-z plane so that you have two symmetrical arms on the creature.

### Task 1.4 Generate legs<span style="color:#0000ff;"> 2%  </span>

Write a method to generate two legs for the creature. The leg-generating part is very similar to the arm-generating process with a couple of modifications. 

I suggest you break down the generating part into 4 steps, just like what we did for 1.2-1.3. i.e., adopt a strategy similar to this:

1. Generate a curve for the right leg. Because the leg is under the arm, the ending point of your curve should have a lower y value in comparison to the starting point. 
2. Generate a shape (e.g., circle) at the start of the curve
3. Extrude the shape along the curve 
4. Reflex the curve and shape to generate the left leg. 

 At the end, you should see designs similar to the following examples.

### Task 1.5 Generate multiple creatures in a grid<span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1.5%  </span>

Test your generator by creating many instances of your design. Make a 5 by 5 grid that is filled with your creature.

### Task 1.6 [Bonus] Add an additional feature to the creature<span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span>
Add at least one additional feature to your creature baseâ€”for example, head, ear, tail, foot, palm, headphone ... anything you like. You can use anything you have learned to create the feature (e.g., poly geometries, curves, extrusion, loft, revolve).
