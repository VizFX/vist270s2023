title:  "Peer Review Instruction"
---



For every homework set, there are at most three types of tasks to be reviewed. 



1) **Completion Tasks:** Tasks that are covered in the teaching material, or easy tasks that do not require significant peer review. For these tasks, skim through to see if there's anything outstanding. 


	- e.g., if the submission used a different approach than the one demostrated in the teaching material, say "good job"!

	-  If you see anything odd or interesting, point it out. 

2) **Review Tasks**: Tasks that involve some challenges. For these tasks, please complete the review by answering the following questions: 

	-   Q1 *accuracy*: is the code working? You can judge by running the code, reading the code, and reading the output. 

	-  Q2 *readability*: is the code understandable? Are variable names meaningful? Are there comments that explain the logic & plan? Are there confusing operations or magic numbers?

	-   Q3: any other comment? Anything outstanding or exciting about the way this particular task is achieved? 
 
3) **Critique Tasks**: Open-ended and creative tasks. For these tasks, please complete the review by answering the following questions:


	-    Q1 *completion*: Is the submission complete? e.g., did the student complete all required sketches? Did they successfully implement their vision using code? 

	-   Q2 *improvement*: If you were to implement the same sketch, what would you do differently? 

	-   Q3: any other comment? 

In each week, we will post about the questions we want you to review (in blue next to each task). Besides answering these questions, you can propose to give your peer bonus points. If you believe that your peer has created outstanding work that deserve a bonus, please fill in the following paragraph and add it to your review: 

```
I recommend this submission for an additional bonus of x%[x should be less than 2] because [fill your reason here]. 
```

The teaching team will determine whether to award the bonus.
