## Part 1: Maya "2D" Art  [(covered in lab)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvUF57L6T4c)<span style="color:#0000ff;"> 3.5%  </span>

Overview: In part 1 of this homework, we are going to play with Maya to make several pieces of ASCII-style art.


You will start with several geometries (such as `polySphere`, `polyCube`, and `polyCone`) instead of ASCII characters.

Your canvas is `10` cells wide and `10` cells long. 

Create a python script file, e.g., `hw2_part1.py`.

Your initial setup is:
```
#copy the following lines to your hw2_part1.py
import maya.cmds as cmds

 # this list stores functions uses to generate geometries. e.g., running cmds.polySphere() will create a sphere with default settings 
geometry_list=[
    cmds.polySphere,
    cmds.polyCube,
    cmds.polyCone
]
column_ct=10 #width of the painting 
row_ct=10 #height of the painting
```



### Task 1.1: Create a horizontal stripe design. (1%)

![](../../../assets/w3/2022-01-28 15_11_53-Window.png)

Make a horizontal stripe design with these three geometries. Each row of the painting has a different geometry.  


The size of the cell should be changable. 
- e.g., if `cell_size = 1`,  geometries are placed close to each other.  
	- ![](../../../assets/w3/Pasted image 20220128155405.png)
- if `cell_size = 2`, geometries are slightly more spread out 
	- ![](../../../assets/w3/Pasted image 20220128155631.png)

The width and height of your "painting" should be adjustable 
- e.g., when `column_ct=30` and `row_ct=12`, `cell_width= 2`
	- ![](../../../assets/w3/2022-01-28 15_10_55-Window.png)

When you finish
1. Package everything related to this task (exclude the settings like `geometry_list`) into a function called `task1_1`. When you call `task1_1(column_ct,row_ct,cell_size,geometry_list)`, your function will create a painting according to the variables given. 
2. Fill in the screenshot with the output of the following calls:
	1. `task1_1(column_ct=10, row_ct=10,geometry_list=geometry_list,cell_size=2)`
	2. `task1_1(column_ct=20, row_ct=10,geometry_list=geometry_list[:2],cell_size=3)`

### Task 1.2  Modify y-location based on conditions (0.75%). 

In this task, we will adjust the location of all the cones. 
![](../../../assets/w3/2022-01-28 15_13_32-Window.png)
 
Assuming that the third geometry function in your `geometry_list` is always polyCone, write a function `task1_2` so that the y location of all the cones are adjustable. 
e.g., 
```
def task1_2(column_ct,row_ct,cell_size,geometry_list,y_loc):
	#### todo 
```

 
To illustrate: 
-  when you run  `task1_2(column_ct=10,row_ct=10,cell_size=2,geometry_list=geometry_list,y_loc=3)`, You will get a similar image
	- ![](../../../assets/w3/Pasted image 20220128160943.png)
- when you run `task1_2(column_ct=10,row_ct=10,cell_size=2,geometry_list=geometry_list,y_loc=-3)`
	- ![](../../../assets/w3/Pasted image 20220128161135.png)

When you are done with this step, fill in the answer sheet. 


### Task 1.3  Add random rotation (0.75%)
In this task, you will add random rotations to your geometries. 

![](../../../assets/w3/2022-01-28 15_18_14-Window.png)


For each geometry, apply a random rotation. By random rotation, it means that it rotate an arbitrary degree along the x, y, and z axis. 

To set the minimum and maximum degrees that the geometry can rotate, create a list to store the lower/upper bounds: 
```
deg_limit=[-100,100] #minimal rotation degree=-100, maximum rotation degree=100

```

You can use `random.uniform()` to generate a random degree. 

Write a function `task1_3(column_ct,row_ct,cell_size,geometry_list,y_loc)` so that every time you run this function, you generate a scene similar to this. 

![](../../../assets/w3/2022-01-28 15_18_26-Window.png)

Fill in the answer sheet. 



### Task 1.4  Create a horizontal stripe design (1%)

Create a function called `task1_4(column_ct,row_ct,cell_size,geometry_list,y_loc)` that generates designs similar to this:

![](../../../assets/w3/Pasted image 20220128162814.png)
- Each column has a different geometry 
- The y-location of the cones are determined by the `y_loc` parameter 
	- ![](../../../assets/w3/Pasted image 20220128163036.png)
-  Each geometry is randomly rotated. 

When you finish, fill in the answer sheet. 

### Task 1.5 (BONUS, optional) making a bridge-shaped design (0.5%)

Write a function `task1_5` that generates the following design 

![](../../../assets/w3/Pasted image 20220128163611.png)


- The basic setup is similar to task 1.4.
	- each column contains a different geometry
	- each geometry has a random rotation 
- Odd columns have negative y positions while even columns have positive y positions 
	- ![](../../../assets/w3/Pasted image 20220128163752.png)
- For even rows:
	- The first half of the rows have gradually increasing y locations, while the second half of the rows have gradually decreasing y locations. 
- For odd rows, it's the opposite, i.e., 
	- The first half of the rows have gradually increasing y locations, while the second half of the rows have gradually decreasing y locations. 
- How fast the y location increases/decreases should be controllable. e.g., a variable like `y_increment` should be defined so that 
	- `y_increment=1` produces
		-  ![](../../../assets/w3/Pasted image 20220128164233.png)
	- `y_increment=4` produces
		-  ![](../../../assets/w3/Pasted image 20220128164355.png)



When you are done, fill in the answer sheet.

## Part 2: Tile design 

Task overview: Write code to generate a 2D [tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile) pattern that could be used for wallpaper or fabric design.  
- A tile is a rectangular design that can be indefinitely repeated and extended. 
	- e.g., using the same tile design, you can make a painting with 1000 x 1000 cells, or 15 x 12 cells. 
- Design something you would want to put on your walls or you would want to wear. We might have a class-wide exhibition for this assignment. 

 If we love your design, you will get <span style="color:#0000ff;"> BONUS (0.1-0.5%)  </span>
###  Task 2.1, sketches <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span> 
Look for inspirations online (search for wallpaper/fabric design), and make at least **3**  sketches (manually, or with your ipad/phone/computer, do not code it). Your designs need to follow these rules: 
1. It should be rectangular. There are tiling works with non-rectangular shapes ([e.g., this example](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_Tiles_(7433823224).jpg), and [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dirry_hexagon_tile_at_a_DC_Subway_stop.jpg)), but in this assignment, please stick with rectangular tiles like [this example](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_Tiles_(7433823224).jpg) or [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_and_white_Tiles_0027.jpg). 
2. It should have more than 2 colors 
	1. e.g., black + white + gray is fine
3. It's designed for repetition. You are designing one tile to be repeated across your entire wall ([like this example](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Decorative_tiles#/media/File:Geometria.jpg)) instead of designing many unique tiles ([like this example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile#/media/File:Ganshoren_avenue_Broustin_10_1002.jpg).) However, your tile can change as you repeat them. 
	1. For example, in Vera Molnar's piece: [Transformations(2/18)](https://arthistory.uchicago.edu/happenings/events/rave-zsofi-valyi-nagy-1) , each cell looks slightly different from each other. But the overall look of the tile remains the same. 


What you design is up to you, but here are several suggestions: 

1.  Give consideration to aesthetics of your design. Think about symmetry, rhyme, color, and balance. 
2. Think about how you are tiling your designs. 
	1. Your tile needs to be rectangular, but doesn't need to be a square. e.g., [long tile](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Wall_tiles#/media/File:Azabujuban_station_Oedo_platform_wall_tiles.jpg)
	2. Think about which angle works the best for your design. e.g., [45](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_Tiles_(7433823224).jpg) vs. [90](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_and_white_Tiles_0027.jpg)?
	3. You don't have to tile them in a spreadsheet-like grid. e.g., [long tiles](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Herringbone_bond.svg) 
3.  I recommend start simple. Use many straight lines. If you are designing [an elaborate floral pattern](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wall_paper_Belville.png) , it might be difficult for you to implement at this stage. It's still good to sketch it down, but I recommend saving these sketches for later. 

**When you finish the sketch, take a picture of it and paste your sketches to your answer sheet.** 

### Task 2.2 turn your sketch into code <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1.5%  </span>

Create a script as `hw2_part2.py`

Write a script to implement one of your sketches using the [turtle graphics package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html). 
- The specific implementation is up to you.  But we recommend that you:

1.  develop a function that contains all the instruction needed for one tile 
		- e.g., 
```
def tile(tile_width,tile_height,cell_x,cell_y):
	### implement all actions necessary for drawing a tile at the location of (cell_x,cell_y)
```

 2. write another function that repeat your tile across the row and column. 
	 e.g., 
```
def repeatTiles(column_ct,row_ct):
	# write loops to call the tile function according to the column and row count. 
```
You can watch this 5-min demo video about the [turtle speed setting](https://youtu.be/3sbagh4a7u0), which walks through the turtle.speed() and screen.tracer() functions. Using these functions will help you to speed up the animation. 
 
 After implementing it, run with the following specs:
 1. `column_ct=10,row_ct=10`
 2.  `column_ct=16,row_ct=9`
 3.  `column_ct=100,row_ct=100` # If your hardware can't handle this, use `column_ct=30,row_ct=30`
 
 **Take a screenshot for each of these output. Paste the screenshot to the answer sheet.** 

 


### Task 2.3 Write a paragraph about your design.  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

In the paragraph, includes  
- The name of your design 
- Description of your design
- Inspiration for your design. 
- Challenges encountered in implementing your design. 

Write the paragraph as a comment in your hw2_part2.py, also paste it to the answer sheet. 

Save your script as `hw2_part2.py`

Tips: 
- The turtle documentation page is your friend. https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html.  Don't limit yourself to functions that we covered in class. 
- It's ok if your generated output looks slightly different from your sketch
