## Part 1: Maya Tetris Coloring[(partially covered in lab)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVzRtpTwdpc):  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 3%  </span>



**Overview**:  We will build a set of Tetris pieces in Maya. [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) is a classical game that features 7 unique pieces (called "[Tetrominones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino)"). We will implement each Tetromino in this lab and make patterns with them.

### Task 1.1 Making  I, O, T, J Tetrominoes. <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

Tetriminoes have specific colors. We will start by defining a dictionary that stores color information. 

```
color_dict={  
    "cyan":(0,0.8,0.8),  
	 "blue":(0,0,1),  
	 "white":(1,1,1),  
	 "green":(0,1,0),  
	 "yellow":(1,1,0),  
	 "orange":(1,0.4,0),  
	 "red":(1,0,0),  
	 "magenta":(0.8,0,0.8)  
}


```

Check the shape and color for [Tetromino I, O, T, and J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino). Implement four tetromino functions that generate these pieces. 

e.g., the function for I Tetromino should be similar to the following:

```

def I_piece(thickness,unit,shader):  
    '''  
	 Generate one I piece.
	 :param thickness:
	 :param unit: unit grid size
	 :param shader: the shader used to color the I piece 
	 :return: the name and type of the I piece.   
    '''
	#todo 
```

When calling, the I-piece function will generate a geometry like this.

The T piece and the J piece will use the `polyUnite()` function to merge multiple poly cubes together. 
e.g., T piece:

J piece:

### Task 1.2 Making  L, S, Z Tetrominoes <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.75%  </span>

 Implement the generation functions for L, S, and Z. Calling these functions will generate the following geometries:

 L shape

 S shape

 Z shape

### Task 1.3 Making a filled rectangle pattern <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

Tetrominoes can fit into rectangles in different ways. In this task, implement one of the patterns. 

![](../../../assets/w6/Pasted image 20220218200437.png)
(img credit: screenshot of [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino) )

Implement a function that generates the first pattern. By calling this function, you will create an image similar to this:

### Task 1.4 Implement another pattern <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1.25%  </span>


![](../../../assets/w6/Pasted image 20220218200437.png)
(img credit: screenshot of [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino) )

Pick another pattern from the image above and implement a function that generates the selected pattern. 


### Task 1.5 [Bonus Optional] Implement a pattern of your own<span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>
In this task, use the tetrominoes to build a pattern of your own. You can develop your own design or search for inspiration/references. There are several rules:
1. The design must use all seven types of tetrominoes.  
2. The design must contain rotated pieces.

## Part 2: Snowflake Design  

[No Snowflakes are alike.](https://www.wired.com/story/the-science-behind-why-no-two-snowflakes-are-alike/)


In this challenge, you will design your snowflakes using turtle graphics. 



### Task 2.1, sketches <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span> 
Search for snowflake references. I recommend checking the work of [Alexey Kljatov](https://alexey-kljatov.pixels.com/) . 

Sketch ideas of your snowflakes-generating system. Here are several tips:


1. Think about different sections of the snowflake. How many sections does your snowflake have? 
2. Think about color. It's not necessary to limit your color palette. 
3. Think about how your snowflakes are different from each other. Try defining a set of rules that would generate your snowflakes but allow some randomness. 

Make at least 3 sketches. 
 

### Task 2.2, turn your sketch into code  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 2%  </span> 

Create a script `hw5_part2.py`

 
You are implementing a snowflake generator in  `hw5_part2.py`


Please make sure your function is specified as following: 

```

def snowflake(canvas_size):  
    '''  
  
	 Given the size of the canvas, generate a snowflake at the center of the canvas. 
 
	 :param canvas_size: the size of the canvas. 
	 :return: screen: the screen you painted on. 
 
 '''  
 #TODO

```

Make sure that:

1. All of your snowflake-generating scripts are stored in the snowflake function. 
2. You utilize the canvas size variable. We will test your code with different canvas sizes. Therefore, make sure your snowflake is scalable. 
3. You set up your own `turtle` and `screen` within the snowflake function. 
4. You are returning your `screen` instance. 
5. You can test your code in the same file, but please comment out the function call and the `T_mod.done()` statement before you submit. 
6. No snowflakes are alike. Your generator should produce different snowflakes every time it is called. 


**Bonus Opportunity** <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.1-0.5%  </span>: If we love your design and implementation, you will get bonus. 


### Task 2.3 Write a paragraph about your design.  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

In the paragraph includes  
- The name of your design 
- Description of your design
- Inspiration for your design. 
- Challenges encountered in implementing your design. 

Write the paragraph as a comment in your `hw5_part2.py`, also paste it to the answer sheet.
