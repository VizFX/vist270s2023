***[Answer Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Oao1qi8UKuUOPo1mNiRtXApJBI2E5KeHBPEda93IUo/edit)***

## Part 1: ASCII Art ([covered in lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4KUora8d30))

[ASCII ART ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) are images made with ASCII characters (95 common characters such as the alphabet and numbers). In the first part of this assignment, let's make some ASCII Art. 

You have 4 different characters to use, including `"!","#","*","@"`. They are stored in a list called `charList`. 

Your canvas is `30` characters wide and `12` characters long. 

Create a python script file, e.g., `hw1_part1.py`.

Your initial setup is:
```
#copy the following lines to your hw1_part1.py
charList=["!","#","*","@"] # you have 4 characters to use 
column_ct=30 #width of the painting 
row_ct=12 #height of the painting
```

### Task 1.1: Create a horizontal stripe design. (1%)

Make a design (a *string*) with characters in the `charList`. The design is stored in a variable called `painting0`. Each **row** of the painting has a different character. 

When you call `print(painting0)`, you should see the following image. 

![](../../../assets/w2/Pasted image 20220119174023.png)
- You are writing expressions that GENERATE this painting. Please don't type make a long string manually. 
- If you change the value of `column_ct` and `row_ct`, you should get a painting with different dimensions. 
	- e.g., when `column_ct=80` and  `row_ct=8`, your painting will look like 
	- ![](../../../assets/w2/Pasted image 20220119174259.png)
- Hint: 
	- `\n`  is the new line character in Python 
	-  Common string operations like `+` and `*` are really helpful here  
- When you are done, fill in the [answer sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Oao1qi8UKuUOPo1mNiRtXApJBI2E5KeHBPEda93IUo/edit) with the following outputs:
	- `column_ct=30` and  `row_ct=12`
	- `column_ct=80` and  `row_ct=8`
- When you fill in the answer sheet with the screenshot, please make sure you include the command you ran in the command prompt/terminal.
	- e.g., ![](../../../assets/w2/vist270w2-01.png)

- You can comment out the print statement and move to the next task. 

### Task 1.2: Create a vertical stripe design <span style="color:#0000ff;">  1.5%  </span>
Make a second design (a *string*) with characters in the `charList`. The design is stored in a variable called `painting1`. Each **column** of the painting has a different character. 

When you call `print(painting1)`, you should see the following image 
![](../../../assets/w2/Pasted image 20220119183330.png)

- Make sure the number of characters on each row matches your `column_Ct` variable. If 30 characters are difficult to count, change the column_ct variable to `5` for debugging. 
- Hint:
	- ` str.join()` is a very useful method that stitches items in a list. You can take a look at this [example](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/string/join), or the [official documentation ](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join)
	-  You have 4 characters. You can think about bundling these characters together. Then each bundle is 4 characters long. You have 30 columns, so you can repeat this `int(30/4)=7` times. How do you know the number of the remaining columns? 
		- If the remaining column count is `r`, how do you get the first `r` characters from the `charList`
- When you are done, fill in the [answer sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Oao1qi8UKuUOPo1mNiRtXApJBI2E5KeHBPEda93IUo/edit) with the following outputs:
	- `column_ct=30` and  `row_ct=12`
	- `column_ct=80` and  `row_ct=8`



### Task 1.3: Frame your work <span style="color:#0000ff;">  1.5%  </span>
Let's frame our work by creating a boarder around the painting. You are going to use `-` and `|` to make a boarder. 

Let's try to frame an empty painting now. Let's set up the horizontal and vertical framing material first.   
```
vertical="|"
horizontal="-"

```

The empty painting is easy to create. Each row of the empty painting is:

```
empty_character=" "
empty_row=empty_character*column_ct
```

Write a script to produce a framed empty painting that looks like this. 
![](../../../assets/w2/Pasted image 20220119192544.png)
- Hint: the corner of the frame is empty (an `empty_character` ) because we don't have a 90-degree corner character. If I change `empty_character` to something else, the framing result will change as well. 

```
empty_character="E"
####hidden: write your frame code 
print(framed_empty_painting)
```
will create the following painting:

![](../../../assets/w2/Pasted image 20220119193150.png)




After framing the empty painting, frame one of your paintings. 


 When you are done with the step, fill in the [answer sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Oao1qi8UKuUOPo1mNiRtXApJBI2E5KeHBPEda93IUo/edit) :
 1. with a screenshot of the framed empty painting.
 2. with a framed `painting0` or `painting1` 
	 1. ![](../../../assets/w2/Pasted image 20220119194403.png)

### Bonus Task 1.4 (optional):  Frame with a mat 
 <span style="color:#0000ff;">  (0.2-0.7%)  </span>

 A [mat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat_(picture_framing)) always makes a painting look better! A mat adds additional boarders between image and the frame. In this bonus challenge, you are:
 1. Making a new painting. You choose the dimension, characters to use, and your own composition. 
	 1. You are still writing script to generate your painting. Do not manually type a painting. 
	 2. Completing this step willk give you <span style="color:#0000ff;">  0.2%  </span>
 2. Frame your painting with a mat. <span style="color:#0000ff;">  0.5%  </span>
	 1. If your mat takes 3 characters, your end result might look like: 
	 2. ![](../../../assets/w2/Pasted image 20220119195133.png)
	 3. Your mat size should be stored in a variable, e.g. `mat_size=3` so that you can try different mats. 
		 1. e.g.,  `mat_size=6` 
		 2. ![](../../../assets/w2/Pasted image 20220119195324.png)


This is the end of HW1 part 1. Save your python script so far as `hw1_part1.py`. You will create a new python script for part 2.

## Part 2: Turtle Graphics <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 2.5%  </span>

This is an open-ended challenge for you to create a painting with the turtle graphics package. We will talk about turtle graphics package in class, but I encourage to check out additional resources such as this video [A Little Bit About Turtle Graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t0Ye3WMmiQ).

[Sol LeWitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt) is an American artist. In this challenge, you are getting some inspiration from LeWitt's paintings and making a painting in Python. 

### Task 2.1 , make a sketch <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span>
Take a look at [this Sol LeWitt's painting collection](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/) and make **3** sketches (manually, or with your ipad/phone/computer, do not code it now). You have 3 rules: 
1. You can only use lines 
2. You have to use more than 20 lines 
3. You cannot use more than 500 lines 

When you finish the sketch, take a picture of it and paste your sketches to your answer sheet. 
 
### Task 2.2 , turn your sketch into code <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1.5%  </span>
Write a script to implement one of your sketches using the [turtle graphics package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html). 
- After implementing it, run and take a screenshot of the final output. Paste the screenshot to the answer sheet. 
- It's ok if your generated output looks slightly different from your sketch
- BONUS opportunity: If you use more than 3 color in your painting, you get  <span style="color:#0000ff;">0.1% bonus </span>


Save your script as `hw1_part2.py`


### Bonus Task 2.3 (optional), google doodle challenge. <span style="color:#0000ff;">0.2% bonus </span>

In lab 1, you were encouraged to play with [this Google Doodle game](https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-50-years-of-kids-coding). If you finished all levels, take a screenshot of your solution to level 6 and a screenshot of your level map. Paste your images to the answer sheet. 

- If you agree to participate in this bonus challenge, you agree that you will not google the solution. 
- If your solution is too long to be contained in one screenshot, you can make multiple screenshots. 
- Have fun :)
