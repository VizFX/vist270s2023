## Part 1: Maya Sphere Design [(partially covered in lab)](https://youtu.be/i-fHZrnHWq4):  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 2.5%  </span>

Overview: In part 1 of this assignment, we are going to play with different ways to make a sphere. The objective is create a sphere using a unit geometry (e.g., sphere, cube)

The result of the sphere will look similar to this ![](../../../assets/w4/Pasted image 20220204203238.png) 

We will attempt to create a sphere using three different methods:
1. By checking if a point is on a sphere 
2. By creating a sphere using a formula 
3. By extracting vertices from an existing sphere. 

Write your part 1 in a file `hw3_part1.py`


### Task 1.1 Make a sphere by checking <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

The strategy of this approach is to 
1. Get every point in a cube.
	1. There are infinite points, therefore we have to define the gap between each point  
2. Check if each point sits on the surface of a sphere
	1. To do that, we need to know what defines a sphere: the distance between any point on a sphere to the center of the sphere is equal to the radius. To put that into an equation, it means `r==math.sqrt(x**2+y**2+z**2)`
3. If a point is indeed on a sphere (or close enough), we place a unit geometry on that point.  


Write a sphere generating function that will take a parameter r

```
def sphere_check(r):
	#todo 
```

Calling the function will generate a sphere similar to this:
![](../../../assets/w4/Pasted image 20220204204456.png)

To make the spherical structure more clear, you can shrink the size of the unit geometry. e.g., 

![](../../../assets/w4/Pasted image 20220204204956.png)

When you are done, fill in the answer sheet. 

### Task 1.2 Make a sphere by formula <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>
The strategy of this approach is to find the mathematical formula for sphere. Using the formula, we can find the coordinate of points on a sphere. 

Read through the [cartesian coordinate section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system) on the Wikipedia page for spherical coordinate system. Implement a function that would generate spheres. e.g., 
```
def sphere_formula(r):
	#todo 
```
Calling the function will generate a sphere similar to this:
![](../../../assets/w4/Pasted image 20220204205604.png)
When you are done, fill in the answer sheet. 


### Task 1.3 Make a sphere using a reference <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>
Overall strategy: we already know how to create a polySphere in Maya. Therefore, we can 
1. Create a polySphere according to the given radius  
2. Get all vertices on the polySphere 
3. For each vertex, place a unit geometry there 
4. Delete the reference polySphere. 

Implement a function that would generate spheres. e.g., 
```
def sphere_reference(r):
	#todo 

```

Calling this function will generate a sphere similar to this 

![](../../../assets/w4/Pasted image 20220204205930.png)

You can adjust the radius to get different configurations 
![](../../../assets/w4/Pasted image 20220204205956.png)

When you are done, fill in the answer sheet.

### Task 1.4 Make a torus <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span>

Now you know three different approaches to create a basic geometry in Maya. Your task is to write functions that generate [Torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus) instead of spheres. 

The end result will be similar to:

Pick two approaches and implement functions using the selected approaches. 
e.g., complete two of the following three functions 

```

def torus_check(size):
	#todo 

def torus_formula(size):
	#todo 

def torus_reference(size):
	#todo 

```

## Part 2: Tile design <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 4%  </span>

Task Overview: Construct a series of five tile designs (stored as functions of drawing instructions) that work for most tiling compositions. 

In the previous assignment, you designed one tile with a specific setting. In this assignment, you are a coherent set of designs that are more flexible. Here are the objectives:

1. You are designing five **SQUARE** tiles that would work together. They are related but should be significantly different.  
2. The tiles are scalable. It should work for any tile size: e.g., 40x40px, 10 x 10 px, 100 x 100 px. 
	1. e.g., your designs should work in both of the following compositions:
		1. ![](../../../assets/w4/layout0.png) 30 px, 10 by 10 grid 
		2. ![](../../../assets/w4/layout0_lg.png) 50px, 25 by 5 grid 
		3. ![](../../../assets/w4/layout3.png) randomized location and size 
3. The tiles design contains some randomness. Every time you generate a tile, it should look slightly different. 
	1. For example, in Vera Molnar's piece: [Transformations(2/18)](https://arthistory.uchicago.edu/happenings/events/rave-zsofi-valyi-nagy-1) , each cell looks slightly different from each other. But the overall look of the tile remains the same. 
4. BONUS <span style="color:#0000ff;">  (0.25%)  </span>: if your tile support rotation of a random degree.
	1. e.g.,
		1. ![](../../../assets/w4/rotA.png)


 If we love your design, you will get <span style="color:#0000ff;"> BONUS (0.1-0.5%)  </span>


### Task 2.1, sketches <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span> 
 
Look for inspirations online (search for wallpaper/fabric design), and make at least **3** sets of sketches(15 mini sketches). You can do so manually, or with your ipad/phone/computer, do not code them at this stage. 


Your designs need to follow these rules: 
2. It should have more than 2 colors 
	1. e.g., black + white + gray is fine
3. It's designed for repetition. You are designing one tile to be repeated across your entire wall ([like this example](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Decorative_tiles#/media/File:Geometria.jpg)) instead of designing many unique tiles ([like this example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile#/media/File:Ganshoren_avenue_Broustin_10_1002.jpg).) However, your tile can change as you repeat them. 
	1. For example, in Vera Molnar's piece: [Transformations(2/18)](https://arthistory.uchicago.edu/happenings/events/rave-zsofi-valyi-nagy-1) , each cell looks slightly different from each other. But the overall look of the tile remains the same. 



### Task 2.2 turn your sketch into code <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 2.5%  </span>

Create a script `hw3_part2.py` and  `hw3_part2_test.py`. Download the `layout.py` from [this link](https://github.com/LiciaHe/vist270s2022/blob/master/assets/w4/hw3_template_code/layout.py). **Make sure your `layout.py` is in the same folder with `hw3_part2.py`  and `hw3_part2_test.py`**  

* `hw3_part2.py` stores all the information you need to generate the tile designs. It will have at least five functions (one for each tile design). Calling these functions with a specific cell setting will trigger a drawing at a particular location. 
	* Each function must follow this exact format:
		* `def tile0(turtle,screen,x,y,size,rotation=0): #change to tile0, tile1, tile2...`
		* Even if you are not doing the bonus rotation part, you should have rotation=0 as an argument in your function. 
		* **Make sure your function name and arguments match the format exactly, otherwise our test script will not be able to run your code.** 
	* You can have more than 5 functions in the file. It would be helpful to construct helper functions that are shared across multiple designs. 
To illustrate, your file might look like 

```
import turtle as T_mod  
  
def helper0():  
    #todo  
  
def helper1():  
    # todo  
	
def tile0(turtle,screen,x,y,size,rotation=0):  
    # todo: design 0
	
def tile1(turtle,screen,x,y,size,rotation=0):  
    # todo: design 1

def tile2(turtle,screen,x,y,size,rotation=0):  
    # todo: design 2

def tile3(turtle,screen,x,y,size,rotation=0):  
    # todo: design 3

def tile4(turtle,screen,x,y,size,rotation=0):  
    # todo: design 4

```

**You shouldn't call any of these functions directly in this script. Your `hw3_part2.py`  serves as a library.** 


`hw3_part2_test.py` is a file for you to test your designs. In this file, you will 
	* import `layout.py`, which we have written for you. 
		* You can download the `layout.py` from [this link](https://github.com/LiciaHe/vist270s2022/blob/master/assets/w4/hw3_template_code/layout.py). **Make sure your `layout.py` is in the same folder with `hw3_part2.py`  and `hw3_part2_test.py`**  
		* `layout.py` stores several testing layout that tiles your designs.
	* import your `hw3_part2` as a module 
	* Put your tile designs into test layouts with the following format:
		* e.g., after implementing `tile0`, running the following code will generate a painting with your tile design. 

```
import layout 
import hw3_part2 as HW3 
  
layout.layout0(  
    tile_func=HW3.tile0,  
	show_result=True,  
	display_canvas_boundary=True,  
	display_cell_boundary=True  
)

```

### Task 2.3 Write a paragraph about your design.  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

In the paragraph, includes  
- The name of your design 
- Description of your design
- Inspiration for your design. 
- Challenges encountered in implementing your design. 

Write the paragraph as a comment in your `hw3_part2.py`, also paste it to the answer sheet. 
### BONUS: Task 2.4 Design a layout <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>
We will test your tile designs with different layouts. However you might have a specific layout in mind. Design a grid layout that you think would work best for your designs.  
- Develop the script in a new file `hw3_part2_layout.py`
- Design something different than what we have shown. i.e., you can't submit the standard table grid, the grid with slightly shifted x or y, or the completely random grid.
