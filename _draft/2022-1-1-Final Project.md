## Overview 

In this final project, you are going to design and implement a character generator. Your goal is to design the visual form(s) for a character or a group of characters using Pillow and Maya. You can design this character for your future animation, gaming, storytelling, or illustration projects.

There's no limitation in what type of characters you design. It could be imaginary creatures or life forms that exist around us. It could be objects, geometric patterns, or even a stroke of color. As long as you can tell a compelling story with this character's visual appearance, it is an acceptable character for this project. 

You can take one of these two main directions:

1. Design a generator that creates a species/group of characters that share similar characteristics yet differ in appearance.
	1. For example, the [fishdraw project by LinDong Huang](https://fishdraw.glitch.me/) creates various pictures of fishes. 
	2. [works of zancan](https://twitter.com/zancan) feature generated plants, rocks, and other natural elements. 
	3. The [Chimera project by mpkoz](https://www.artblocks.io/project/233) features floral designs.  
	4. [SlimHoods by James Curran](https://www.slimhoods.com/)
	5. [Pizza 1o1 by KALA](https://www.artblocks.io/project/240)

2. Design a generator that creates variations of one character. 
	1. e.g., generate different facial expressions for one character
	2. [Supermental by Rosenlykke](https://www.artblocks.io/project/285)

**EARLY BIRD BONUS:** if you complete the final project by **4/29 10 pm**, you will get a 1% bonus. You need to finish everything (sketch, code, documentation) before the 4/29 deadline to qualify for the early bird bonus. We will award the bonus based on your latest canvas submission time. 



## Task 1: Design the character  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span>

Conduct your own research and design the character using sketches and writing. When designing the character, consider the following aspects:

1. What are the natural behaviors associated with your characters? What do they do to survive? 
2. What kind of environment do they live in? How does the environment impact their appearance and behavior? 
3. What's the relationship between individual characters and members of their species? Do they travel in packs, fight with each other, or live by themselves?  
4. Do they evolve under certain conditions? How?   

I recommend watching [this video about character design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf5HqRtEFcA&ab_channel=PixologicZBrush). 

Produce at least 3 annotated drawings that illustrate 
1. The front, side, and top view of the character you are designing. If your character is 2D, provide the front view. 
2. the potential variations of your generator. e.g., if you designed a cat generator, illustrate how your cats are different from each other. If you designed a facial expression generator, illustrate how the facial expression changes. 
3. the movement of your character. e.g., how does it "walk," move, expand, or change shape/location/expressions. 

Upload these sketches to canvas. 

The deadline for this step is **Wednesday, 4/20 10 pm.** 


## Task 2: Implement the generator  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 2%  </span>
### Task 2.1 Implement a 2D generator  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 2%  </span>
Write one of multiple python script(s) that generate(s) the character in 2D. How you implement the script is up to you. You can create utility functions or classes in different scripts and utilize them to create your character. We ask that you provide a python script called `final_project_2D.py`. Running the `final_project_2D.py` will generate one image that contains one character. 

- Make sure we can run your python script. If you used multiple scripts to generate your character, please upload all of them. 
- Make sure your `final_project_2D.py` will trigger an img.show() event. 

### Task 2.2 [Bonus, optional] Implement a 3D generator  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 2%  </span>

Write **one** python script that generates the character in 2D. Due to the Maya importing issue, we ask that you submit one python script called `final_project_3D.py`. Running the `final_project_3D.py` will generate one 3D model.  

### Task 2.3  [Bonus, optional] Add animation to one of the generators  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 2%  </span>

Add movement to your characters. You can choose to do this in 2D or 3D. Before starting, I recommend reviewing/learning about the [principles of animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiGY0qiy8fY&ab_channel=Entertainment). 

Implement your animation in `final_project_animation_2D.py` or `final_project_animation_3D.py`. If you generated 2D animations, your script should export a gif file to the script-storage location (e.g., don't add "output/" to the path because your graders might not have the same file location setup as you). If you generated 3D animations, your `final_project_animation_3D.py` should produce the model and the animation altogether. 


## Task 3: Document the generator  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span>

Make a copy of [the template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WOW3cpLs9lZYFLm_krYuWJN0HjAnvj80ZzAgEkO4Q2U/edit#slide=id.g124025ef6b2_0_25) and fill out the slides with your design. Upload your code and documentation of your slides to canvas. 

If your implemented bonus task 2.3., we want to have a link to your slides (in addition to the pdf version). Please include a link in your slide deck.
