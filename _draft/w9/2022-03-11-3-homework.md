**[ANSWER SHEET](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TQiIvce44WbQEniwuW43_JOdSACKsguodBqtDEtJPAc/edit#)**



**Overview:** In this homework set, we will make our own brush sets that can render different paths. We will make multiple 3D brushes and 2D brushes.  

You are provided with some test paths in the file `test_paths.py` [LINK TO test_paths.py](../../../assets/w10/test_paths.py)
In the `test_paths.py` file, there are two dictionaries defined:

```
three_dim_paths={}

two_dim_paths={}

```

Each dictionary stores a group of path information. You will use `three_dim_paths` for part 1 in Maya, and `two_dim_paths` for part 2 in Python + PIL. 

In each dictionary, you have the following key-value pairs:

```
three_dim_paths={
	"curves":[...], #stores 3 curves  
	"lines":[...],  #stores 3 lines  
	"polygons":[...], #stores 3 polygons 
}

two_dim_paths={

	"curves":[...], #stores 3 curves  
	"lines":[...],  #stores 3 lines  
	"polygons":[...], #stores 3 polygons 
	
}

```

e.g., to get a 2D curve, you can import the `test_paths` and call `two_dim_paths["curves"][idx]` while the idx could be equal to `0`, `1` or `2`. 

Similarly, to get a 3D line, call `three_dim_paths["lines"][idx]` while the idx could be equal to `0`, `1` or `2`.  


## Part 1: Maya Brush Design [( video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zDtc2Z4M-w):  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 3%  </span>


### Task 1.1 Construct a Brush Class and a DisplayBrush<span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

We will construct a python class called `Brush` for both part 1 and part 2 of this assignment. The `Brush` class should be initiated with some default information, including but not limited to:
1. Setting # a dictionary of additional parameters that Brush objects should store. 

The `Brush` class should have at least one method: `render`. `Brush.render(path)` method should take a path (i.e., a sequence of coordinates), and render the brush stroke according to the given path. 

e.g., given a curve:

![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320144909.png)

A `Brush` could render this curve into a textured design. 

![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320145237.png)

After initiating the `Brush` class, let's create a class called `DisplayBrush` that inherits the `Brush` class. In the `render` method, the `DisplayBrush` should simply visualize the given path without adding additional form or texture. 

i.e., given a path `[(-5.0, 0, 0), (-4.999232441354929, 0, -0.43216969458539783), (-4.996847897710064, 0, -0.8500428855208211),.....]`, an instance of the `DisplayBrush` should be able to render the path on Maya. 

![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320144909.png)

e.g., running the following lines:

```

d_brush=DisplayBrush()
d_brush.render(three_dim_paths["lines"][2])

```

should produce a result similar to this

![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320151621.png)

Running `d_brush.render(three_dim_paths["polygon"][2])` should produce

![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320151726.png)



### Task 1.2 Implement a CubeBrush <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

Implement a class called `CubeBrush`, which renders a given path with cubes. 

e.g., running the following lines 

```
brush=CubeBrush()  
brush.render(three_dim_paths["curves"][0])

```

will produce a design similar to this. 

![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320153742.png)

Depending on how you set the cube's width, depth, and height, your results will differ from the image above. e.g., you might see the following results. 


![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320153943.png)

and

![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320154017.png)



### Task 1.3 Improve the CubeBrush with flexible settings <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span>

Besides a default cube width, height, and depth setting, the CubeBrush should accept cube settings from the users. Therefore, modify your `CubeBrush` and `Brush` class so that users can pass `cube_width`, `cube_height`, and `cube_depth` as part of the brush setting. 

e.g.,  pass additional settings to the `CubeBrush` init function. 

```

brush0=CubeBrush(  
    setting={  
        "cube_width":1,  
		 "cube_height":0.1,  
		 "cube_depth":1  
	 }  
)  

```

Calling `brush0.render(three_dim_paths["polygons"][2])` will produce

![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320154443.png)

When changing the setting to different values, you should see different rendering results:

```
brush1=CubeBrush(  
    setting={  
        "cube_width":2,  
		 "cube_height":2,  
		 "cube_depth":1  
 }  
)  
  
brush1.render(three_dim_paths["polygons"][2])

```

### Task 1.4  Implement a PolyGeometryBrush <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1% completion task </span>

Implement a new brush class called `PolyGeometryBrush`. The new brush inherits the `Brush` class. Instead of using `polyCube`, the `PolyGeometryBrush` renders using a geometry. 

You can select a Poly geometry,

e.g., PolySphere
![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320155120.png)

PolyCylinder:

![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320155336.png)

PolyPyramid:

![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320155424.png)



### Task 1.5 [ Bonus, Optional]  Use multiple geometries in your PolyGeometryBrush<span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.25%  </span>

Instead of fixing on one poly geometry, modify your `PolyGeometryBrush` to utilize a list of polygon geometries. 

Utilize the following list of polygeometry functions in your `PolyGeometryBrush`

```

poly_func_lst=[cmds.polyPyramid,cmds.polyCube,cmds.polySphere,cmds.polyCylinder]

```

so that your render method would render the 1st point with a pyramid, the 2nd point with a cube and so on.

![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320160110.png)


### Task 1.6 [ Bonus, Optional]  Add color to your CubeBrush <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>




Modify your `CubeBrush`  so that it could take a shader as part of the `setting`. The rendered result should utilize the given shader when you render a path. 

e.g., running the following code 


```
blue_shader=cmds.shadingNode("lambert",asShader=True)  
cmds.setAttr(blue_shader + ".color", 0, 0, 1, type="double3")  
cube_brush=CubeBrush(  
    setting={  
        "shader":blue_shader  
    }  
)  
cube_brush.render(three_dim_paths["curves"][1])

```

will produce a result similar to this:

-------------END OF PART 1---------------------


## Part 2: 2D Brush with Pillow 

**Overview**: You will implement similar brushes in 2D with Pillow. You can test with the paths we provided in `test_paths.py` . Instead of using `three_dim_paths`, make sure you are using `two_dim_paths`. Each of the paths in `two_dim_paths` has a maximum width of 500px and a maximum height of 500px. You should generate a PIL image that is larger than 500 x 500.  


### Task 2.1, Construct a Brush Class and a DisplayBrush Class for 2D images <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5% Completion Task </span> 

The 2D brush  `Brush` class should be very similar to the one you defined in part 1. It have at least one method: `render`. `Brush.render(path,img_draw)` method should take a path (i.e., a sequence of coordinates), and render the brush stroke according to the given path on a given `img` using the `img_draw` object. 

After initiating the `Brush` class, let's create a class called `DisplayBrush` that inherit the `Brush` class. In the `render` method, the `DisplayBrush` should simply visualize the given path without adding additional form or texture. 

e.g., 


```
img, img_draw, center, width, height = makeImg(width=500,height=500)  
d_brush=DisplayBrush()  
d_brush.render(two_dim_paths["polygons"][2],img_draw)  
img.show()

```


The block of code above should produce the following result:

![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320163436.png)




### Task 2.2,  Implement a RectBrush <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1% Completion Task </span>

Similar to Cube Brush, the `RectBrush` would render the path with rectangles. 

```
img, img_draw, center, width, height = makeImg(width=500,height=500)  
r_brush=RectBrush({"w":10,"h":10})  
r_brush.render(two_dim_paths["polygons"][2],img_draw)  
img.show()

```

Would produce the following image

![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320164548.png)

Users should be able to adjust the width and height of the rectangle:

``` 
r_brush=RectBrush({"w":25,"h":10})  
r_brush.render(two_dim_paths["polygons"][2],img_draw)  
img.show()

```

![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320164739.png)


### Task 2.3,  Implement a Polygon Brush <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1% Completion Task </span>

Implement a `PolygonBrush` that renders paths with random polygons. 
e.g., 
```
p_brush=PolygonBrush()  
p_brush.render(two_dim_paths["polygons"][2],img_draw)

```
 
 
will produce 
![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320165229.png) 
 
### Task 2.4,  Add color to your brushes <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5% Completion Task </span>

Modify your `PolygonBrush` and your `RectBrush` so that users can pass a custom rgb value to the brush. The rgb value will be used when rendering the image. 

e.g., 

```
p_brush=PolygonBrush(setting={"color":(0,0,255)})  
p_brush.render(two_dim_paths["polygons"][2],img_draw)

```

![](../../../assets/w10/Pasted image 20220320165703.png)


### Task 2.5 [ Bonus, Optional]  Implement your own brush <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span>

Be creative! Write and test a brush of your own design.
