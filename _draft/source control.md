## Learn and install a version control software (Optional)

Version control will make your programming life easier. 

It is optional for this class, but I highly recommend you learn about git. You can find plenty of tutorials/reading on this topic online. If you do not want to use command prompt/terminals for version control, you can also find tools with interfaces, such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).
