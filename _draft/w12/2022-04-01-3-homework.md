**Overview:** In this homework set, we will build data-inspired sculptures and paintings. We will process weather data obtained from [weather underground](https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/us/tx/college-station) and generate 3D and 2D designs based on these data. 

## Part 1: 3D Data Sculpture [( video)](https://youtu.be/jGwnDoW1K7U):  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 3%  </span>


### Task 1.1 Process Data <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span>

We will create a 3D sculpture inspired by the 2022 January college station weather data. Download [temperature_2022_01.csv](https://github.com/LiciaHe/vist270s2022/tree/master/assets/w12/temperature_2022_01.csv), which is a csv ([comma-separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file) obtained from [weather underground](https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/us/tx/college-station)

The file's first row lists the data name and source; the 2nd row lists the column name. 
In a conventional spreadsheet, the data looks like this:  

![](../../../assets/w12/Pasted image 20220403010303.png)

CSV format means individual rows are separated into lines ("\n" character), and each column is separated with a comma. i.e., if you open the CSV file with your code editor or any text-editing software, you will see the table in a format similar to the following:

![](../../../assets/w12/Pasted image 20220403010510.png)

Write a python file `data_processor.py` which reads and processes this file into the following format:

1. The first two lines are skipped 
2. The date, max, avg, min values are mapped in their individual ranges:
	1. date is mapped onto the range of -10 to 10. i.e., the minimum value in the "date" column is mapped to the value of -10, and the maximum value in the "date" column is mapped to the value of 10.  
	3. max temperature range=[-5,5]
	4. average range = [-3,3]
	5. min range= [-8,10]
6. The processed data (4 columns) are written into a new CSV file that looks similar to the following image: 


![](../../../assets/w12/Pasted image 20220403011007.png)

You can adjust the range of these values, but it's recommended that you start with the sample range. 


### Task 1.2 Modify CubicBezierGenerator <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.25%  </span>

We will create the data sculpture with the `CubicBezierGenerator` we created during class. You can use your own implementation, or download the following code: 

- [`CubicBezierGenerator.py`](https://github.com/LiciaHe/vist270s2022/tree/master/assets/w12/CubicBezierGenerator.py)
- [`ParametricGenerator.py`](https://github.com/LiciaHe/vist270s2022/tree/master/assets/w12/ParametricGenerator.py)
- [`Brush.py`](https://github.com/LiciaHe/vist270s2022/tree/master/assets/w12/Brush.py)


The original implementation of the `CubicBezierGenerator`  can only create 2D curves. Modify the `CubicBezierGenerator` so that users can control whether to generate a 3D curve or a 2D curve: 

- If `two_dim` is set to `True,` then the generator will produce 2D curve. i.e., create x and y values using the cubic-bezier equation. 
- If `two_dim` is set to `False`, then the generator will produce 3D curve. i.e., create x, y, and z values using the cubic-bezier equation. 



### Task 1.3 Create Sculpture <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.75%  </span>

We will create 3D sculptures using the information extracted from the processed data. Write a program that 
1. loads data from the output of task 1.1. 
2. Use combinations of the data as control points for `CubicBezierGenerator` to generate a list of curves 
3. Combine curves to make a surface using the `loft()` function. 
4. Delete Curves. 

You control how these data are combined or randomly generate the combinations. When running this program, you will create designs similar to the following examples:

### Task 1.4 Create another variation <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span>

Create another sculpture generator using the same data. You can create the design by modifying the existing pipeline or creating something completely new, considering using other brushes that you have implemented so far. 


### Task 1.5 [Bonus, Optional] Color the data sculpture <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

Add color to the result of 1.4.  







## Part 2: 2D Data Painting:  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 3.5%  </span>

In this challenge, you will design a 2D painting using other weather data. 

You will create a 2D painting inspired by the 2022 Feb college station weather data. Download [windspeed_2022_02.tsv](https://github.com/LiciaHe/vist270s2022/tree/master/assets/w12/windspeed_2022_02.tsv), which is a tsv ([tab-separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) file) obtained from [weather underground](https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/us/tx/college-station)

The first row of the file lists the data name and source; the 2nd row lists the column name. 
In a conventional spreadsheet, the data looks like this:  


![](../../../assets/w12/Pasted image 20220403012920.png)

TSV format means individual rows are separated into lines ("\n" character), and each column is separated with a tab. i.e., if you open the tsv file with your code editor or any text-editing software, you will see the table in a format similar to the following:

![](../../../assets/w12/Pasted image 20220403013021.png)




### Task 2.1 Plan <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

Write/sketch a plan for your design. It should include at least three aspects:
1. What column(s) and row(s) from the data do you plan to use for your data-inspired design. You can use all columns or a subset of columns? Do you want to use data for the entire month or data from certain days?
2. What do you need to do to format your data. e.g., do you need to map the data to a specific range? 
3. How would you use the data in your design? What graphical attributes are they controlling? 

You might need to add sketches to explain your design. 


### Task 2.2 Process Data <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>
Write a data processor script file that process the data according to your plan.  Save processed file as `windspeed_processed.tsv`


### Task 2.3 Implement your design <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 2%  </span>
Create a script `hw10_part2.py` that implements your design. Export your design into jpg and upload it. 

Considering using some of the classes and utility functions you have implemented before. 

 
**Bonus Opportunity** <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.1-0.5%  </span>: If we love your design and implementation, you will get bonus. 


### Task 2.4 Documentation <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

The paragraph includes  
- The name of your design 
- Description of your design
- Inspiration for your design. 
- Challenges encountered in implementing your design. 

Write the paragraph as a comment in your `hw10_part2.py`, and also paste it to the answer sheet.
