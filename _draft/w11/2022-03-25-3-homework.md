**Overview:** In this homework set, we will look at [parametric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation) design and implement some common parametric equations. We will continue to practice object-oriented programming through the Brush classes we initiated last week. 

[Parametric Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation) are functions that express coordinates of point in relation to independent variables (called parameters). Most of the geometries we work with in this class can be specified through parametric equations.  

For example, instead of defining a circle as 

```
(x-a)**2+(y-b)**2 =r**2

```

a parametric for a circle is defined as 

```

x=a+r*cos(t)
y=b+r*sin(t)

```

You can also take a look at the following example from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation)

## Part 1: 3D Parametric Design [( video)](https://youtu.be/ehpchPyLdN4):  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 3%  </span>


### Task 1.1 Construct a Parametric Generator Class  and Modify the Brush Class <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>
Parametric equations (i.e., parametric representations of equations) are widely used in computer graphics.  In this homeowork, we want to generate designs with parametric equations. Overall, we will follow this plan: 

1. Create several parametric design generators that can produce coordinates. 
	1. We will need 3D coordinates for Maya, and 2D coordinates for Pillow. 
2. After generating the design (coordinates), we will render these designs with Brush classes that we created before. 
	1. e.g., in Maya, we will render our design with CubeBrush. In Pillow, with RectBrush instead. 

To start, let's create a base class called `ParametricGenerator`. The generator should have the following characteristics:

1. It takes a variable `setting` at initiation, and can accept additional parameters through this `setting` variable. (Just like what we did for the `Brush` class last time)
2. It has a method called `produce_design`. When this method is called, it will return a list of coordinates.
3. It also has the following methods: `scale_and_translate`, `produce_2d_design`, and `produce_3d_design`. We will cover these methods later, it's ok to leave them empty for now.

After initiating the `ParametricGenerator` class, we want to modify our `Brush` class from last assignment. In last assignment, we created two `Brush`  classes. One for 2D (which takes a `img_draw` for its `render` method), and another takes no additional parameter for the `render` method.  We also defined 2 additional `DisplayBrush` classes for 2D and 3D rendering. 

Write a new `Brush` class so that it has 
1. a method called `render_2D`, which takes a path and a an `img_draw` object. Produce a line with the given `img_draw`
2. a method called `render_3D`, which takes a path. Produce a curve using `Maya.cmds.curve`.


Test your `Brush` class in 2D and 3D environment. 



### Task 1.2 Implement a CircleGenerator <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

Implement a `CircleGenerator` class that inherits from the `ParametricGenerator` class. The equation for circles can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation#Circle) 

You will need to: 
1. Define some default settings. e.g., the center of the circle, the radius of the circle, the range of the t value and etc. 
2. Implement the `produce_design` method 

Once this is done, you should test the generator with a `Brush` instance. You can only render on a 2D surface (PIL canvas) at this moment because the `CircleGenerator` is producing a sequence of 2D coordinates.

Also, your design might be difficult to see on a pillow canvas if your default location is (0,0) and the radius is 1. An 1-pixel circle on the top left corner of your canvas is not easily visible. Therefore, also implement the  `scale_and_translate` so that you can generate circles at any given location and in any given radius. 

After the implementation, you can produce designs like the following:


![](../../../assets/w11/Pasted image 20220327172605.png)


using similar blocks of code like:

```

from Canvas import Canvas  
from Brush import Brush  
from ParametricEquation import *  

cg=CircleGenerator()  
c=Canvas()  
b=Brush()  

b.render2D(  
    path=cg.scale_and_translate(  
        scale_factors=(100,100),  
		translates=c.center  
    ),  
	img_draw=c.img_draw  
)  

b.render2D(  
    path=cg.scale_and_translate(  
        scale_factors=(100, 200),  
		translates=c.center  
    ),  
 img_draw=c.img_draw  
)  

b.render2D(  
    path=cg.scale_and_translate(  
        scale_factors=(200, 100),  
		translates=c.center  
    ),  
	img_draw=c.img_draw  
)

c.img.show()

```


### Task 1.3 Implement 2D-3D conversion methods  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span>
The `produce_design` method of `CircleGenerator` can only produce 2D sequences. However, to draw a circle in Maya, we need 3D coordinates. The easiest way is to add a default value to the missing dimension. 

e.g., transfer `(3,5)` into `(3,0,5)` or `(3,5,0)` or `(0,3,5)`. Depending on which plane that users want to draw the 2D design on, we could add a default value to the missing dimension. Users should be able to set the default value. 

Add an attribute `two_dim` to the `ParametricGenerator` class. The `two_dim` attributes is a boolean attribute that indicate whether the generator produces 2D coordinates or 3D coordinates. The `two_dim` attribute should be `True` for the `CircleGenerator` class. 

Implement the `produce_3d_points` method in `ParametricGenerator`. This method takes 3 parameters: `scale_factors`, `translates`, and `add_dim` . When it's called, it would:
1. produce a design that is scaled and translated to the target location. 
2. If the design is 3D, return it 
3. If the design is 2D, add a default value to the dimension that users indicated. `add_dim` is an integer that stores the index of the dimension. e.g., add_dim=0 means we are adding the default value to x axis. add_dim=2 means we are adding to the z axis. 

After implementing this method, test it in Maya. 

The following code 


```
cg=CircleGenerator()  
b=Brush()  
b.render3D(  
    path=cg.produce_3d_points(  
        (10,10),  
		 (0,0),
		 add_dim=1  
    )  
)
```

should produce a design similar to this 



![](../../../assets/w11/Pasted image 20220327173717.png)

Changing the `add_dim` should generate circles on different planes: e.g.,

### Task 1.4 Implement HelixGenerator  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.75%  Completion Task </span>

In this task, implement a `HelixGenerator`. The equation for helix can be found on [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation#Helix) To understand more about individual parameter, I recommend checking out the [Mathematical description section on Helix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix). 

After implementing it, you should be able to generate helix like this 
![](../../../assets/w11/Pasted image 20220327174841.png)


If the setting of your helix is too big or too long, it might be difficult to see on Maya.  You can try to the following setting: 

```
{  
 "t_range":(0,math.pi * 10),  
 "t_step_ct":300,  
 "a":3,  
 "b":0.25  
  
}

```


### Task 1.5 Render a parametric-generated design with a 3D brush  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.25% Completion Task  </span>

Take one of the generators and one of the 3D brushes you have, produce a rendered result. 

e.g., the following design is produced with the `HelixGenerator` and the `CubeBrush`

![](../../../assets/w11/Pasted image 20220327175333.png)


The `CircleGenerator` and `CubeBrush` produces the following design: 
![](../../../assets/w11/Pasted image 20220327175648.png)



### Task 1.6 [BONUS] Implement the 3D-2D conversion method  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

Complete the `produce_2d_design` method, which would convert a sequence of 3D coordinates into 2D coordinates. 

e.g., transfer `(3,4,5)` into `(3,5)` or `(3,4)` or `(4,5)`. Depending on which plane that users want to keep. 

After implementing this function, you should be able to use your 3D generators (e.g., `HelixGenerator`) in 2D designs. 

For instance, if y-axis is removed, you will get a x-z plane view, which is the same with the "top" and "bottom" view in Maya

![](../../../assets/w11/Pasted image 20220327180436.png)



![](../../../assets/w11/Pasted image 20220327180727.png)


If x-axis is removed, you will get a similar view because the x-z plane view is almost identical to the y-z plane view. 


If you remove the z-axis, you will get a circle instead, which corresponds to the "front" view in Maya.

### Task 1.7 [BONUS] Design another 3D parametric generator  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span>

Create and test a parametric generator of your own. You can implement other well-known parametric surfaces  (e.g., torus) or implement your own. Considering adding an additional dimension to a 2D equation. 

After implementing the generator, test the generator in Maya.

## Part 2: 2D Parametric Design:  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 3.5%  </span>


**Overview:** You will implement a spirograph generator and use it in 2D environment. You will continue to use the `ParametricGenerator`, `Brush` and `Canvas` classes you implemented before.  [Spirograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph) are created with two types of curves: [Hypotrochoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotrochoid) and [Epitrochoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitrochoid)




### Task 2.1, Construct a Hypothrochoid Generator <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1% Completion Task </span> 


Implement a class called `HypothrochoidGenerator`, which inherits from `ParametricGenerator` and produce Hypotrochoid curves. 

Test it with Pillow. 

Example: 
The following code 


```
c=Canvas()  
b=Brush()

setting={  
    "R":5,  
 "r":3,  
 "d":5,  
 "theta_range":(0, math.pi * 2*10),  
 "theta_step_ct":30*10  
}

hg=HypothrochoidGenerator(setting)

b.render2D(  
    path=hg.produce_2d_points(  
        scale_factors=(10,10),  
		 translates=c.center,  
		 ),  
 img_draw=c.img_draw  
)

```

Will produce an example similar to this.

### Task 2.2, Construct a Epitrochoid Generator <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1% Completion Task </span> 


Implement a class called `EpitrochoidGenerator`, which inherits from `ParametricGenerator` and produce Epitrochoid curves. 

Test it with Pillow. 

The same setting as the previous example 
```

setting={  
    "R":5,  
 "r":3,  
 "d":5,  
 "theta_range":(0, math.pi * 2*10),  
 "theta_step_ct":30*10  
}

```

will produce the following design 

![](../../../assets/w11/Pasted image 20220327183901.png)



### Task 2.3, Create designs with your parametric generators <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1% Critique Task </span> 

Play with different settings and create a design using your parametric generators. Create 3 designs that use one or more of the parametric generators you have implemented. Your canvas size should be at least 2500x2500 pixels. Focus on the structure of your designs. 



### Task 2.4, Render your designs with Brushes <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5% Critique Task </span> 

Add textures to your design by rendering them with any of the `Brush` classes you have created so far.  The `Brush` class itself doesn't add any texture, so you should not use it. `RectBrush`, `PolyBrush` or any other brush classes you implemented is ok.



### Task 2.5,[Bonus, Optional] Create spirograph in 3D <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5% Completion Task </span> 

Your spirograph generators should also work in 3D. Test these generators in 3D.
