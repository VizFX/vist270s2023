## Part 1: Maya Globe Design [(partially covered in video)](https://youtu.be/-aECL-1bkVc):  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 3%  </span>

**Overview:** We will make a globe design in Maya and add animation.

### Task 1.1 Build a hollow sphere <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>
Build a hollow sphere using the difference Boolean operation: `cmds.polyBoolOp`

The first sphere is slightly bigger than the second one. After the operation, the sphere would look similar to this. 

TIP: you can set the transparency of your default material so that the hollow structure is clear.

### Task 1.2 Cut the hollow sphere with random cylinders <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>
We will try to cut random holes on the hollow sphere. Generate 10-20 cylinders that go through the sphere. Use the difference operation again to cut holes on the hollow sphere.

### Task 1.3 Animate the sphere <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>
Add animation to the sphere so that it rotates around the Y-axis.

### Task 1.4 Add mini spheres around the hollow sphere <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>
Add 10-50 mini spheres around the hollow sphere.

You can refer to hw3 for approaches that generate geometries on coordinates of the spheres. If you use one of the approaches in HW3, make sure you limit the number of spheres you are creating. If you generate too many spheres, it might be challenging for your machine to handle the animation.


### Task 1.5 Add animation to the mini spheres <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span>

Animate these mini spheres so that they rotate around the hollow sphere.

## Part 2: 800 x 80 GIF Design  

**Overview**:  In this design challenge, you are making a short gif animation with the PIL package. The 800x80 design challenge has been an ongoing online art challenge on platforms like Twitter. The GIF is 800 px wide and 80 px tall, making an extra-wide canvas with unique design opportunities and constraints. 

Take a look at the `#800x80` examples on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/800x80?src=hashtag_click), and design your own 800x80 gif. 

**Your design should follow these rules:**

1. It's 800px by 80 px 
2. It has at least 10 frames. Typically, a video has the FPS (frame per second) of 24, 30, or 60, meaning that to produce 1 second of video, you should have 24, 30, or 50 frames (i.e., images). The number could be lower because we are producing GIF animation, but 10 frames are minimal. You can go above 10 frames. 
3. It uses each of the transformation methods (translation, rotation, and scale) at least once. 
 

### Task 2.1, sketches <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span> 
Take a look at the `#800x80` examples on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/800x80?src=hashtag_click) Sketch ideas of your design.


Here are several tips:


1. Think about individual elements in your design. What are they? Are they changing during the animation? If yes, how do they change? What graphical attributes(e.g., color, location, size, etc.) are changing? 
2. Think about color. 
3. Think about the beginning and end of your animation. How many frames would it take to modify your elements from their beginning status to the ending status?


In this task, describe your design visually and verbally. You don't have to draw out all frames, but a couple of frames would be helpful. Your "sketch" here should clearly communicate how your animation work. The more clear your design is, the easier it is for you to implement.  

### Task 2.2, turn your sketch into code  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 2%  </span> 

Create a script `hw7_part2.py`
 
You are implementing your gif design in  `hw7_part2.py`

After the implementation, export the gif as `hw7_part2.gif` and upload to canvas

**Bonus Opportunity 1**  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.1-0.5%  </span>: If we love your design and implementation, you will get bonus. 

**Bonus Opportunity 2**    <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span> Objects in real-life almost never move at a constant speed. Therefore, easing functions are used in animation to make moment more natural.

In this bonus task: 
1. Do a mini research about easing functions
2. Implement a non-linear easing function, 
3. and utilize a non-linear easing function in your animation

I recommend the following resources:
 - https://easings.net/
 - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8316882/what-is-an-easing-function


### Task 2.3 Write a paragraph about your design.  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

In the paragraph includes  
- The name of your design 
- Description of your design
- Inspiration for your design. 
- Challenges encountered in implementing your design. 

Write the paragraph as a comment in your `hw7_part2.py`, also paste it to the answer sheet.
