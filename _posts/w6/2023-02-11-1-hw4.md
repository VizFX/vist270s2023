## Part 1: Maya Cube Coloring

**Overview:** We will build a Rubik's cube in Maya today. [Rubik's Cubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube) are classical puzzle toys made of cubes. In this lab, we will build a static Rubik's cube. Then, we will build examples included in [this website](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/rubiks-cube-patterns-algorithms/)

### Task 1.1 Making and coloring a cube. 
Before making a Rubik's cube, let's make one polyCube and color it according to the Rubik's cube rule. 

A standard 3x3 Rubik's cube has six colors: Assuming the top side is white and the front side is blue, the color arrangement is as follows:
- Front: Blue, Back: Green
- Top: White, Bottom: Yellow
- Left: Red, Right: Orange 

You can check [this online guide for the setup](https://www.rubiks.com/en-uk/rubiks-cube-3x3-guide)

Maya set up the color using RGB percentages. Therefore, the colors can be stored in a format similar to this: 

```
color_list=[(0,0,1),(1,1,1),(0,1,0),(1,1,0),(1,0.4,0),(1,0,0)]  
color_keys=["B","W","G","Y","O","R"]
```

Task: Make a 10 x 10 cube that is colored according to the Rubik's cube.

Hint: 
1. You will need to create shaders. I recommend using lambert (flat, matte shader). 
2. You will need to select individual faces. 
	1. To select, use `<object_name>.f[<idx>]`.  `<object_name>` is the name of the cube. By default, it's *pCube1*. `f` stands for *face* here. The variable `<idx>` is the index of the face. 
	2. A cube has six faces, indexed in the following order: [Front, Top, Back, Bottom, Right, Left]
3. You can add shade using the method `hyperShade(shader)` . `shader` here is the variable that stores your shader. 


### Task 1.2 Making a colored Rubik's cube <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>
The simplest way to produce a colored rubik's cube is to repeat task one 3 times in each direction. Develop a function that generate a design similar to this :
![](../../../assets/w5/Pasted image 20220210170153.png)

### Task 1.3 Make a more accurately colored rubik's cube <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

In the actual manufacturing process, sides that are hidden will not get colored. e.g., the top two rows should not be colored blue in an actual cube because these sides will never be visible. 
![](../../../assets/w5/Pasted image 20220210170420.png)

Write a function that generates the more accurately colored Rubik's cube. 
The outside looks very similar to the previous task.

However, the non-visible sides should not get color

### Task 1.4 Make Patterned Cubes <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1.5%  </span>

Rubik's cubes can make beautiful patterns. In this task, write 5 functions to generate 5 different pattern designs by altering the color. 

Please take a look at [this website](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/rubiks-cube-patterns-algorithms/), which provided a list of cube patterns : 
https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/rubiks-cube-patterns-algorithms/

Pick **five** patterns out of this website. For each pattern, write a function to color your cube according to the pattern. 

Tips:
- Some patterns are easier than others. Start with the simple ones where you can clearly see the rules that determine these coloring decisions. 
- If you want to see the hidden sides, the website has animations that project the hidden sides. Click on the pattern and go to the last step. 


**BONUS Opportunity** : Pass the color information as a list. 

- A straightforward way to create cube patterns is to simply copy 1.3 for every pattern and modify the conditions at each for-loop level. Nevertheless, it is not very efficient because you are rewriting many lines of code. To solve this issue, modify your pattern-generating code to produce a list of coloring instructions for all cube units. Write a function that would take the instruction list as an argument, then execute the coloring plan. 
- To illustrate, this is a sample code structure 

 ```
def coloring_cube_by_instruction(instruction, other_param0, other_param1):  
    '''  
	 Coloring a Rubik's cube according to the instruction 
	
	 :param instruction: a list of coloring instruction
	 :param other_param0:
	 :param other_param1:
	 :return:   
    '''  
 #TODO   
   
def pattern0(param0,param1):  
    '''  
	Produce a list of instruction for a pattern, 
	  call the coloring_cube_by_instruction function
    '''  
	#TODO
 
 ```



Fill out the answer sheet for this task. 

### Task 1.5 (BONUS: OPTIONAL):Rubik's cube of any size
Besides the 3x3 cube, Rubik's cube has many other configurations: e.g.,   2x2, 4x4, 10x10. Write a function that generates and colors Rubik's cube of different sizes.

## Part 2: Custom Pixel 

"*Pixels are fundamental building blocks of bitmap images and digital displays.*  (Levin, Golan, and Tega Brain. _Code as Creative Medium: A Handbook for Computational Art and Design_. MIT Press, 2021.)."

Most images we see today are made of pixels: mini squared color blocks. We want to experiment with the idea of using simple geometries as unit building blocks for images. 

In this challenge, you will design your own pixel system that would work for all grayscaled images. i.e., you are creating a mapping between your unit pixel designs to all possible grayscale values (256 in total).



### Task 2.1, sketches 
Sketch ideas of your pixel system. Here are some tips:
- There are 256 values in the grayscale. 0 is black, 255 is white. Think about what would represent the darkest value on your image. 
- What if your pixels are not squares? 
- What if they overlap or have different sizes? 
- What if they are icons or symbols? 
- Although you are implementing a grayscale pixel system, you can use color. 

I recommend checking the work from textile art, ASCII art, collage works, and installations like [Daniel Rozin](http://www.smoothware.com/danny/) for inspiration.

 
In this task, describe your design visually and verbally. You don't have to draw out all 256 designs, but your "sketch" here should clearly communicate the relationship between these grayscale values to your design. 

### Task 2.2, turn your sketch into code 


 Create a script `hw4_part2.py` and  `hw4_part2_test.py`. Download the `pixel_layouts.py` from [this link](https://github.com/LiciaHe/vist270s2023/blob/master/assets/w5/hw4_template_code/pixel_layouts.py). **Make sure your `pixel_layout.py` is in the same folder with `hw4_part2.py`  and `hw4_part2_test.py`**  

 You are implementing a function that accepts a grayscale value and some PILLOW-related info and draws customized a customized pixel on a particular spot. Therefore, your goal is to implement the following function in `hw4_part2.py`

```

def my_pixel_system(gray_scale_val,img_draw, x, y, pixel_size):
    '''

    Given a gray-scale value,
    Produce a drawing in the designed location that as the rendering of that pixel.

    :param gray_scale_val: an integer that represents the grayscale value. 0 is black, 255 is white.
    :param img_draw: img_draw object used to perform the drawing
    :param x: top left corner of the original pixel
    :param y: top left corner of the original pixel
    :param pixel_size: the width and height of a pixel
    :return:
    '''
```

** You shouldn't call any function directly in this script or `pixel_layout.py`. Your `hw4_part2.py`  and `pixel_layout.py` serve as libraries. All function calls will be made in `hw4_part2_test.py` ** 


During the implementing process, you will want to test if your pixel system works. Therefore, we provide another layout library called `pixel_layouts.py`.

You can construct an image with your pixel system by calling the following function: 
```
#hw4_part2_test.py: used to test my pixel system implementation 


import pixel_layouts  
import hw4_part2 as HW4
  
pixel_layouts.construct_an_image(  
	pixel_function=HW4.my_pixel_system,  
	emoji_option=0 # There are 6 images in the layout library. Set this value to an integer from 0 to 5 to see different layouts  
)

```
For example, you have defined the following pixel system:
```

def my_pixel_system(gray_scale_val,img_draw, x, y, pixel_size):
    '''
    # example: draw a rectangle with the given gray color.
    coor=[
        (x,y),
        (x+pixel_size,y),
        (x+pixel_size,y+pixel_size),
        (x,y+pixel_size),
        (x,y)
    ]
    img_draw.polygon(coor,gray_scale_val)
```

By running your `hw4_part2_test.py`, you will see an image similar to this:

![](../../../assets/w5/hw4_task2_demo.png
)

The template file is available at 

- [pixel_layouts.py](https://github.com/LiciaHe/vist270s2023/blob/master/assets/w5/hw4_template_code/pixel_layouts.py)
- [hw4_part2.py](https://github.com/LiciaHe/vist270s2023/blob/master/assets/w5/hw4_template_code/hw4_part2.py)
- [hw4_part2_test.py](https://github.com/LiciaHe/vist270s2023/blob/master/assets/w5/hw4_template_code/hw4_part2_test.py)


**Bonus Opportunity** : If we love your design and implementation, you will get bonus. 


### Task 2.3 Write a paragraph about your design. 

In the paragraph, includes  
- The name of your design 
- Description of your design
- Inspiration for your design. 
- Challenges encountered in implementing your design. 

Write the paragraph as a comment in your `hw4_part2.py`, also paste it to the answer sheet.
