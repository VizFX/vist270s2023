## Part 1: Maya "2D" Art  [Lab] (3%) 
Overview: In part 1 of this homework, we are going to play with Maya to make several pieces of ASCII-style art.


You will start with several geometries (such as `polySphere`, `polyCube`, and `polyCone`) instead of ASCII characters.

Your canvas is `10` cells wide and `10` cells long. 

Create a python script file, e.g., `hw3_part1.py`.

Your initial setup is:
```
#copy the following lines to your hw3_part1.py
import maya.cmds as cmds

 # this list stores functions uses to generate geometries. e.g., running cmds.polySphere() will create a sphere with default settings 
geometry_list=[
    cmds.polySphere,
    cmds.polyCube,
    cmds.polyCone
]
column_ct=10 #width of the painting 
row_ct=10 #height of the painting
```



### Task 1.1: Create a horizontal stripe design. 

![](../../../assets/w3/2022-01-28 15_11_53-Window.png)

Make a horizontal stripe design with these three geometries. Each row of the painting has a different geometry.  


The size of the cell should be changable. 
- e.g., if `cell_size = 1`,  geometries are placed close to each other.  
	- ![](../../../assets/w3/Pasted image 20220128155405.png)
- if `cell_size = 2`, geometries are slightly more spread out 
	- ![](../../../assets/w3/Pasted image 20220128155631.png)

The width and height of your "painting" should be adjustable 
- e.g., when `column_ct=30` and `row_ct=12`, `cell_width= 2`
	- ![](../../../assets/w3/2022-01-28 15_10_55-Window.png)

When you finish
1. Package everything related to this task (exclude the settings like `geometry_list`) into a function called `task1_1`. When you call `task1_1(column_ct,row_ct,cell_size,geometry_list)`, your function will create a painting according to the variables given. 
2. Take screenshots for output of the following calls:
	1. `task1_1(column_ct=10, row_ct=10,geometry_list=geometry_list,cell_size=2)`
	2. `task1_1(column_ct=20, row_ct=10,geometry_list=geometry_list[:2],cell_size=3)`

### Task 1.2  Modify y-location based on conditions  

In this task, we will adjust the location of all the cones. 
![](../../../assets/w3/2022-01-28 15_13_32-Window.png)
 
Assuming that the third geometry function in your `geometry_list` is always polyCone, write a function `task1_2` so that the y location of all the cones are adjustable. 
e.g., 
```
def task1_2(column_ct,row_ct,cell_size,geometry_list,y_loc):
	#### todo 
```

 
To illustrate: 
-  when you run  `task1_2(column_ct=10,row_ct=10,cell_size=2,geometry_list=geometry_list,y_loc=3)`, You will get a similar image
	- ![](../../../assets/w3/Pasted image 20220128160943.png)
- when you run `task1_2(column_ct=10,row_ct=10,cell_size=2,geometry_list=geometry_list,y_loc=-3)`
	- ![](../../../assets/w3/Pasted image 20220128161135.png)
	


### Task 1.3  Add random rotation 
In this task, you will add random rotations to your geometries. 

![](../../../assets/w3/2022-01-28 15_18_14-Window.png)


For each geometry, apply a random rotation. By random rotation, it means that it rotate an arbitrary degree along the x, y, and z axis. 

To set the minimum and maximum degrees that the geometry can rotate, create a list to store the lower/upper bounds: 
```
deg_limit=[-100,100] #minimal rotation degree=-100, maximum rotation degree=100

```

You can use `random.uniform()` to generate a random degree. 

Write a function `task1_3(column_ct,row_ct,cell_size,geometry_list,y_loc)` so that every time you run this function, you generate a scene similar to this.

## Part 2: Tile design  (7.5%)
**[ANSWER SHEET](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mO6WFMFlszGSzgAWnQFuFPCoUFPJkLATQ-Ocl35xEv0/edit?usp=sharing)**

Task overview: Write code to generate a 2D [tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile) pattern that could be used for wallpaper or fabric design.  
- A tile is a rectangular design that can be indefinitely repeated and extended. 
	- e.g., using the same tile design, you can make a painting with 1000 x 1000 cells, or 15 x 12 cells. 
- Design something you would want to put on your walls or you would want to wear. We might have a class-wide exhibition for this assignment. 

 If we love your design, you will get <span style="color:#0000ff;"> BONUS (0.1-0.5%)  </span>
###  Task 2.1, sketches
Look for inspirations online (search for wallpaper/fabric design), and make at least **5**  sketches (manually, or with your ipad/phone/computer, do not code it). Your designs need to follow these rules: 


1. It should be rectangular. There are tiling works with non-rectangular shapes ([e.g., this example](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_Tiles_(7433823224).jpg), and [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dirry_hexagon_tile_at_a_DC_Subway_stop.jpg)), but in this assignment, please stick with rectangular tiles like [this example](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_Tiles_(7433823224).jpg) or [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_and_white_Tiles_0027.jpg). 
   1. Your design needs to be responsive. i.e., works for a rectangle of any size. i.e.,the given rectangle could be landscape, portrait, 500 x 500 px , or 100 x 1000 px.  
2. It should have more than 3 colors. You will create with the `RGB` mode instead of the `L` mode. You are not limited to the grayscale colors anymore, but you can choose grayscale if you want. 
3. It's designed for repetition. You are designing one tile to be repeated across your entire wall ([like this example](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Decorative_tiles#/media/File:Geometria.jpg)) instead of designing many unique tiles ([like this example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile#/media/File:Ganshoren_avenue_Broustin_10_1002.jpg).) However, your tile can change as you repeat them. 
    1. For example, in Vera Molnar's piece: [Transformations(2/18)](https://arthistory.uchicago.edu/happenings/events/rave-zsofi-valyi-nagy-1) , each cell looks slightly different from each other. But the overall look of the tile remains the same. 



What you design is up to you, but here are several suggestions: 

1.  Give consideration to aesthetics of your design. Think about symmetry, rhyme, color, and balance. 
2. Think about how you are tiling your designs. 
	1. Your tile needs to be rectangular, but doesn't need to be a square. e.g., [long tile](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Wall_tiles#/media/File:Azabujuban_station_Oedo_platform_wall_tiles.jpg)
	2. Think about which angle works the best for your design. e.g., [45](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_Tiles_(7433823224).jpg) vs. [90](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_and_white_Tiles_0027.jpg)?
	3. You don't have to tile them in a spreadsheet-like grid. e.g., [long tiles](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Herringbone_bond.svg) 
3.  I recommend start simple. Use many straight lines. If you are designing [an elaborate floral pattern](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wall_paper_Belville.png) , it might be difficult for you to implement at this stage. It's still good to sketch it down, but I recommend saving these sketches for later. 

**When you finish the sketch, take a picture of it and paste your sketches to your answer sheet.** 

### Task 2.2 turn your sketch into code

Create a script as `hw3_part2.py`

Write script to implement THREE of your sketches. Remember, your design should be responsive and work for whatever cell size it is given. 

- The specific implementation is up to you.  But we recommend that you:

1. develop a function that contains all the instruction needed for one tile 
        - e.g., 


```
def tile_0(....): #add parameters that you need
	### implement all actions necessary for drawing tile 0 at a specific location
	
def tile_1(....): #add parameters that you need
	### implement all actions necessary for drawing tile 1 at a specific location
	
def tile_2(....): #add parameters that you need
	### implement all actions necessary for drawing tile 2 at a specific location
```

Tips:
- It's ok if your generated output looks slightly different from your sketch
- Use percentages instead of fixed values will make your design responsive. 
- Don't forget to use the "RGB" mode to create colored images.
- Write loops and functions instead of repeating (COPY-PASTE) your script manually. 
- Use img.show() to test output, but don't forget to save the output with img.save(). You will need to add these outputs to the answer sheet.  




For each design, draw it by itself (i.e., one-by-one grid) with the following settings: 
1. Canvas size = 500 x 500 
2. Canvas size = 200 x 800 
3. Canvas size = 600 x 300

For instance, if my first design is a red rectangle with 10% margin, I should generate three images:

![](../../../assets/w4/hw3_2_2_0_demo.png)

Do this for all 3 of your designs. You should end up with 9 images. Paste them in the answer sheet. 

![](../../../assets/w4/hw3_2_2_1_demo.png)

### Task 2.3 Use your designs in grid. 

Implement the following grid design and add your designs into the grid. 

In the following description, I will use red rectangle, green rectangle, and blue rectangle as examples of the three tile designs. 

i.e., 
- tile_design_0 => red rectangle 
- tile_design_1 => green rectangle
- tile_design_2 => blue rectangle

![](../../../assets/w4/hw3_2_3_0.png)

#### Task 2.31 Filling a 2 by 4 grid with Tile 0 
Make an image with the following spec: 
1. Canvas size is 400 by 800
2. Has 2 columns and 4 rows 
3. All cells are filled with tile 0. 

e.g., 

![](../../../assets/w4/hw3_2_3_1.png)

#### Task 2.32 Filling a 3 by 3 grid with 3 designs 
Make an image with the following spec: 
1. Canvas size is 900 by 1200
2. Has 3 columns and 3 rows 
3. Row 0 is filled with tile 0, row 1 is filled with tile 1, row 2 is filled with tile 2

e.g., 
![](../../../assets/w4/hw3_2_3_2.png)

#### Task 2.33 Filling a 3 by 3 grid with 3 designs 
Make an image with the following spec: 
1. Canvas size is 2000 by 800
2. Has 6 columns and 3 rows 
3. Column 0,3 are filled with tile 0, row 1,4 are filled with tile 1, row 2,5 are filled with tile 2. 

e.g., 
![](../../../assets/w4/hw3_2_3_3.png)

Paste the result of 2.31-2.33 to your answer sheet. 

### Task 2.4 Write a paragraph about your design. 

In the paragraph, includes  
- The name of your designs (Each tile gets a name, OR you can name the collection) 
- Description of your designs
- Inspiration for your designs. 
- Challenges encountered in implementing your design. 

Write the paragraph as a comment in your hw3_part2.py, also paste it to the answer sheet. 

Save your script as `hw3_part2.py`
