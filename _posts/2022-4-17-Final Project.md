## Overview 

Welcome to your optional final assignment for creating a game using Pygame!

Your task is to create a game that meets the following requirements:

1. The game must have at least one moving character or object on the screen.
2. The game must have a background that is relevant to the theme of your game.
3. The game must include at least one interaction that requires the use of either the mouse or keyboard.
4. The game must include at least one text string.

Here are some tips to help you get started:

Choose a theme for your game, and design the background and character(s)/object(s) accordingly. This will help make your game more engaging for players.
Make sure your moving character or object is easy to control, and that players can quickly understand how to interact with it.
Add sound effects or music to your game to enhance the player's experience.
Test your game thoroughly to ensure it is fun and challenging for players.
When you are finished, please submit your game along with a brief write-up explaining your design choices and any challenges you encountered during development. Good luck!

## Task 1: Design the game  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1%  </span>

Conduct your own research and design the game using sketches and writing. When designing the game, consider the following aspects:

1. What kind of background will you have? Is it moving or stationary. If moving consider a seamless background for looping.
2. What kind of characters or objects will you have?
   1. Will the character or object change shape. If so consider using sprites for animation.
   2. Will there be collisions
3. What kind of interaction will you have? 

Produce at least 3 annotated drawings that illustrate 
1. The background. 
2. The character(s) and/or object(s)
3. the movement of your character(s)/object(s). e.g., how does it "walk," move, expand, or change shape/location/expressions. 

Include these sketches in the answer sheet.

## Task 2: Implement the game  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 2.5%  </span>
Write one of multiple python script(s) that generate the game using Pygame. How you implement the script is up to you. You can create utility functions or classes in different scripts and utilize them to create your game. We ask that you provide a python script called `final_project.py`. Running the `final_project.py` will execute the game. 

- Make sure we can run your python script. If you used multiple scripts to generate your game, please upload all of them. 
- Include comments for each section to explain what the code is doing.

## Task 3: Document the game  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

## Bonus Opportunity <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.1%-1.0%  </span> :
If we love your game design and implementation, you will get bonus.
