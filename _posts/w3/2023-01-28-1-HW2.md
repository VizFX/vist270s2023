## Part 1: Coordination Plane Exercise [LAB, 3%] 
### Task 1.1 Two Functions for Creating Rectangles 
Rectangles are foundational graphical elements that we will play with frequently in this class. There are two common ways to specify a rectangle: 
![1_1_0](../../../assets/w3/w3_grid-01.png)

In the first approach, users provide the coordinate for the top left of the rectangle (point A), along width and height. i.e., 


```
def draw_rect_from_top_left(top_left,width,height,img_draw):
    ##todo: calculate the coordinates of each corners of the rectangle 
    ##todo: draw the rectangle with the given img_draw 
```

The second approach calculates coordinates of the rectangle with the center of the rectangle (point E). 

```
def draw_rect_from_center(center,width,height,img_draw):
    ##todo: calculate the coordinates of each corners of the rectangle 
    ##todo: draw the rectangle with the given img_draw 
```

**TODO: Implement these two functions. Before you start coding, write down the formula for calculating the coordinates of each corner.** e.g., in approach one, given A, w, and h, pointB equals to ? pointC equals to? In approach 2, given E, point A equals to? point B equals to? 

NOTE 0: Make sure you review the coordinate system for PILLOW. Which direction is the positive X-axis? Which direction is the positive Y-axis? Where's the origin? How do they impact the coordinates for my rectangles? 

NOTE 1: in your implementation, you can choose to have 5 points in your rectangle (i.e., rect=[A,B,C,D,A] so that you always have a closed rectangle if you use the img_draw.line() method). If you have 4 points in your rectangle (rect=[A,B,C,D]), that's also correct. 



After writing down the formula, start a python script called `HW2_part1.py`. You can use the following template to write/test your functions. 

```
from PIL import Image,ImageDraw    
    
def draw_rect_from_top_left(top_left,width,height,img_draw):
    ##todo: calculate the coordinates of each corners of the rectangle 
    ##todo: draw the rectangle with the given img_draw 
    
    
def draw_rect_from_center(center,width,height,img_draw):
    ##todo: calculate the coordinates of each corners of the rectangle 
    ##todo: draw the rectangle with the given img_draw 
    
    
width=300
height=300
size=(width,height)    
    
img_1_1 = Image.new("L", size, 255)
draw_1_1=ImageDraw.Draw(img_1_1) 

###test your functions here 
#draw_rect_from_top_left((60,100),50,80,draw_1_1)
#draw_rect_from_center((220,150),50,30,draw_1_1)
```
The test case above will produce a result similar to:

![1_1_0](../../../assets/w3/hw2_1_1.png)

You can play with different canvas size, starting locations, width, and height. 

### Task 1.2 Creating rectangles in a Row 
Often times the size of the rectangle we want to use is determined by the canvas size. 
e.g., given a canvas with the size of `w` and `h`, we want to be able to fit in `m` equal-sized rectangles in a row. The count of rectangle is stored in the variable `m`. 
![1_1_0](../../../assets/w3/w3_grid-02.png)

First, we need to figure out the width and height of each rectangle. Implement the following function
```
#TODO 
def calcualte_rect_size_in_row(canvas_w,canvas_h,rect_ct):
    '''
    todo calculate the width and height of each rectangle 
    return it 
    e.g., return width, height
    '''
   
```

Then implement a function that would draw a rectangle in a row, given the index of the rectangle. 
```
#TODO 
def draw_nth_rectangle_in_a_row(n,canvas_w,canvas_h,rect_ct,):
    #todo calculate the width and height of each rectangle 
    #return it 
    # e.g., return width, height

```

After implementing these two functions, test your function with the following code: 
```
size_1_2=(500,100)
img_1_2=Image.new("L", size_1_2, 255)
draw_1_2 = ImageDraw.Draw(img_1_2)
draw_nth_rectangle_in_a_row(2,size_1_2[0],size_1_2[1],10,draw_1_2)
draw_nth_rectangle_in_a_row(5,size_1_2[0],size_1_2[1],10,draw_1_2)
draw_nth_rectangle_in_a_row(9,size_1_2[0],size_1_2[1],10,draw_1_2)
```
If everything works correctly, you should see an image similar to this: 

![1_1_0](../../../assets/w3/hw2_1_2_0.png)


### Task 1.3 Creating rectangles in a column 
Similarly, given a canvas with the size of `w` and `h`, we want to be able to fit in `m` equal-sized rectangles in a **Column**.

![1_1_0](../../../assets/w3/w3_grid-03.png)

Implement the following functions:
```
def calcualte_rect_size_in_column(canvas_w,canvas_h,rect_ct):
    '''
    todo calculate the width and height of each rectangle
    return it
    e.g., return width, height
    '''
    
def draw_nth_rectangle_in_a_column(n,canvas_w,canvas_h,rect_ct,img_draw):
    '''
    todo: draw the nth rectangle in the column
    :param canvas_w, canvas_h: width and height of the cavnas
    :param rect_ct: the number of rectangles to be fit in a column
    :param img_draw: an img_draw object used for drawing the rectangle
    '''
```
Test your implementation with the following block of code. 

```
size_1_3=(500,500)
img_1_3=Image.new("L", size_1_3, 255)
draw_1_3 = ImageDraw.Draw(img_1_3)
draw_nth_rectangle_in_a_column(2,size_1_3[0],size_1_3[1],10,draw_1_3)
draw_nth_rectangle_in_a_column(5,size_1_3[0],size_1_3[1],10,draw_1_3)
draw_nth_rectangle_in_a_column(9,size_1_3[0],size_1_3[1],10,draw_1_3)
```
And you will get an image similar to this: 

![1_1_0](../../../assets/w3/hw2_1_3.png)

### Task 1.4 Creating a rectangle in a grid. 
Now let's create a grid. 
Given a canvas with the `canvas_size=(canvas_w, canvas_h)`, we want to create a grid with `p` columns and `q` rows. 



![1_1_0](../../../assets/w3/w3_grid-04.png)

In this case, what's the width and height of a cell within the grid?  Implement the following function that calculates the width and height of a cell. 


```angular2html
##TODO 

def calculate_cell_size_in_grid(canvas_w,canvas_h,col_ct,row_ct):
    '''
    given canvas_w and canvas_h (size of the canvas) 
    and the number of rows (row_ct), the number of columns (col_ct), 
    calculate and return the width and height of a cell inside of the grid. 
    '''
    

```

After figuring out the size of each cell, we also want to be able to calculate the location of each cell. Let's look at a specific example:

![1_1_0](../../../assets/w3/w3_grid-05.png)

The image above is a grid with 3 rows and 5 columns. You will fit 15 cells inside. The top left cell is cell 0. **0 is the index of the first cell**. The second cell on the first row has the index of 1. See if you can answer the following questions: 
1. Without counting individually, can you calculate the index of the last cell? Second to last cell? 
2. What's the index of the cell that sits in the third row, first column? 
3. Given the index of a cell (0,1,2,....14), how to determine which row they are in? After knowing which row they are in, how to get their y-coordinates? e.g., what's the y-coordinates for A, B, C, D, E in relationship to `cell_height`? 
4. Given the index of a cell (0,1,2,....14), how to determine which column they are in? After knowing which column they are in, how to get their x-coordinates? e.g., what's the y-coordinates for A, B, C, D, E in relationship to `cell_width`

Hint0: imagine you have a long band of cells that you are trying in fit in the grid. At certain point, you need to wrap the band to fit the second row, third row, and so on. In this case, division and remainder operations are quite important. 

Hint1: You might need math.floor(),int() or %. 

After figuring out the formula to calculate a location given a single index, implement the following function. You can call the previous functions you have implemented. 

```angular2html

def calculate_cell_loc_in_grid(canvas_w,canvas_h,col_ct,row_ct,cell_index):
    '''
    given canvas_w and canvas_h (size of the canvas)
    and the number of rows (row_ct), the number of columns (col_ct),
    and the index of the cell (cell_index, cell_index is an integer less than row_ct*col*ct) 
    
    calculate and return the coordinate of the top left corner of the cell. 

    '''
```

Once this function is implemented, test it. You can try the following block. 

```angular2html

size_1_4=(600,500)
img_1_4=Image.new("L", size_1_4, 255)
draw_1_4 = ImageDraw.Draw(img_1_4)
col_ct=5
row_ct=3
cell_w,cell_h=calculate_cell_size_in_grid(
    size_1_4[0],
    size_1_4[1],
    col_ct,
    row_ct,
)
draw_rect_from_top_left(
    top_left=calculate_cell_loc_in_grid(size_1_4[0],size_1_4[1],col_ct,row_ct,1),
    width=cell_w,
    height=cell_h,
    img_draw=draw_1_4
)
draw_rect_from_top_left(
    top_left=calculate_cell_loc_in_grid(size_1_4[0],size_1_4[1],col_ct,row_ct,5),
    width=cell_w,
    height=cell_h,
    img_draw=draw_1_4
)
draw_rect_from_top_left(
    top_left=calculate_cell_loc_in_grid(size_1_4[0],size_1_4[1],col_ct,row_ct,14),
    width=cell_w,
    height=cell_h,
    img_draw=draw_1_4
)
img_1_4.show()

```

The code above generates a grid with 5 columns and 3 rows. It draws cells with index 1, 5, and 14. If your code works correctly, you will see something similar to the following image:

End of part 1. Please let your TA know once your group finish.  

## Part 2: Creating grid designs with Pillow (7.5%)

Create a new python script called `hw2_part2.py`. Open this [LINK TO ANSWER SHEET](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16G8TfK1kW_jXy1EB51tnYufm82LS4AcyZbZDA0vIbx4/edit?usp=sharing), make a copy ( File-> Make a copy). For the following tasks, complete the task and paste your output/screenshot of code to the answer sheet. -p

### Task 2.1 calculate rectangles and add margins. 

When we have a grid structure, we might want to add some designs in the cell. Some designs require us to work with the cell width and height.

For instance, the following cell design creates a solid rectangle in the cell. 

![1_1_0](../../../assets/w3/w3_grid-06.png)

Replicate this image. Here are some setups for this image:
1. canvas_size=(600,500)
2. row_ct=3, col_ct=5
3. margin_perc=0.08
4. Draw cell with index of 1, 9, and 12. 
5. Fill the rectangles with black (0)

If your implementation is correct, you will see something similar to this

![1_1_0](../../../assets/w3/hw2_2_1.png)



### Task 2.2 Fit a square inside. 
Here's another design we want to replicate. Instead of working with a known margin, we want to fit the largest possible square inside the cell. 

![1_1_0](../../../assets/w3/w3_grid-07.png)

Add a new design to the previous image with the following spec
1. canvas_size=(600,500)
2. row_ct=3, col_ct=5
3. The inner rectangle should be the largest possible square inside the cell. i.e., you will need to know if cell_width is less than cell_height, or the other way around. Read the documentation for [`min()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min). 
4. The inner rectangle should be centered horizontally and vertically. 
4. Draw cell with index of 2, 5, and 14. 
5. Fill the rectangles with a gray (160)

If your implementation is correct, you will see something similar to this

![1_1_0](../../../assets/w3/hw2_2_2.png)


If you change the canvas size, your design should still work. 
e.g., if `canvas_size=(300,500)`
![1_1_0](../../../assets/w3/hw2_2_3.png)


If `canvas_size=(1000,500)`

![1_1_0](../../../assets/w3/hw2_2_4.png)


### Task 2.3 Sketch

Sketch out 10 different designs (on paper, using other software) that satisfy these rules:
1. Works in a rectangular cell 
2. Has at least 4 lines. Remember, each line can have more than 2 points.  
3. Has at least 1 polygon (i.e., filled shape)

Pick 2 designs, annotate them to the point where you can clearly get the coordinate of each element in the design. 

The annotation should be using generic variables instead of specific numbers. e.g., instead of defining a line with length of 20 pixels, think about how this line's relation to parameters such as `cell_width` and `cell_height`. Is it a percentage of the `cell_width`? What's the percentage? If your grid changes, the design should still work.     

Take a photo/screenshot of your sketch, fill in the answer sheet.
### Task 2.4 Making two designs 
Implement your chosen designs (2 designs) with PIL. Each design is stored in a function that would draw the design in a specific cell. e.g., 


```
def design_A(canvas_size,row_ct,col_ct,img_draw,cell_idx):
    '''
    #todo, draw the design in the given cell. 
    '''
    
    
def design_B(canvas_size,row_ct,col_ct,img_draw,cell_idx):
    '''
    #todo, draw the design in the given cell. 
    '''
```
Fill in the answer sheet. 

### Task 2.5 Inserting designs in a specific location

Make a grid and insert your designs using the following specifications:
1. `col_ct=7`, `row_ct=3`
2. You can decide canvas size. 
3. Fill your designs into the cells as shown in the following image:
