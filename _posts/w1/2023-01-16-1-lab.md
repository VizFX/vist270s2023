3. Maya





 
----------------


## Step 1: Install Python 

1. Install [Anaconda (HIGHLY Recommended)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

**We will use commandline/terminal to run Python script for the entire semester.**

A quick intro about commandline/terminal: [check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b93ehHTCZAE&list=PLLnpHn493BHGmEYzbjWPJsnRMhvs-PSYG&index=2&ab_channel=LevelUpTuts).

*After installing this, please complete the following tasks* 
1. Open your terminal/command prompt/anaconda prompt. 
	1. If you are on windows, and you installed Anaconda, please open *Anaconda Prompt*. If you only installed python only, please open your *command prompt*. 
		1.  ![](../../../assets/w1/Pasted image 20220111111210.png)
	2. If you are on Mac, open your *terminal*.   
		1. ![](../../../assets/w1/Pasted image 20220113111506.png)


2. Navigate to a folder where you would like to store your VIST 270 course content by using the ["cd" command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command). 
	1. e.g., I want to store all of my  `C:\licia\course\VIST270\`. 
	2.  I would first make sure the VIST270 folder exist. Create this folder first. 
	3.  In my command prompt, I would type `cd C:\licia\course\VIST270\`
	4.  After typing that command, my command prompt should show that 
	5.    ![](../../../assets/w1/270week1-01.png)

3.  In your command prompt, type `python`. You should see something similar to this 
  ![](../../../assets/w1/Pasted image 20220111114159.png)
	1. If this gives you error. Here are a few possibilities: 
		1. You installed python3 only, try typing `python3` 
		2. There might be an issue with your installation. Try installing again, and asking us for help. 

4. Find out the value of 2435 times 11345. 
	1. the star symbol * is the multiply operator in Python. e.g. if you type `1*3`, you will see

	3. If you see 27625075 on your screen, congrats! Type `quit()` to exit python.

### Step 2: Install Pycharm

PyCharm is a code editor for Python. You can edit Python files with almost any editor (e.g., text editor). However, a specialized editor like PyCharm can help you to check syntax and organize your code easily. 

If you have other editors you prefer to use, you are not required to swith to PyCharm. However, we will use PyCharm in our demo and lectures. 

To install PyCharm, you have the following two options: 
1. Install the [professional version](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ You will have educational license, which you can obtain from [this website](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students). 
2. You can download the [community version](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) which is an open-source software. 

*After installing PyCharm (or other IDE you prefer), complete the following task:* 

1. Create a new folder called "lab1" in your course folder. 
	1. e.g., make   `C:\licia\course\VIST270\Spring2022\lab1\`. 
2. Create a python file called `lab1.py`
	1.    ![](../../../assets/w1/270week1-02.png)
3.  Write the "hello world " statement in your PyCharm Editor in Lab 1
	1. `print("Hello World!")`
	2.  ![](../../../assets/w1/Pasted image 20220111144112.png)
4. In your command prompt, navigate to the folder that contains the lab1.py 
	1. Use the command `cd`  to go to a directory 
	2. If you need to go to the parent directory, use `cd ../` 
	3. If you want to check what's inside of a directory 
		1. use `dir` if you use windows, 
		2. or `ls` if you use Mac. 
		3.  ![](../../../assets/w1/270week1-03.png)

	2.  Run the lab1 script by typing `python lab1.py` . If you used `python3` instead of `python` in the previous step, you should run `python3` here as well. 
		1. ![](../../../assets/w1/Pasted image 20220111145353.png)
		2. If you see `Hello World` on your command prompt, congrats!	
5. We will use a package called [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)(PIL for short) to assist the making of 2D graphics. 
	1. If you installed Anaconda, you have pillow installed. If not, check the [installation guide](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#basic-installation). 
	2. (Using the Pycharm Editor)In your week 1 folder, create another folder called "pillow"
	2. (Using the Pycharm Editor)In your "pillow" foloder, create a script called "pil_test.py"
	3. (Using the Pycharm Editor)In pil_test.py, paste the following code:
	```
	from PIL import Image
	Image.new("RGB",(400,400)).show()
	```
	4. (Using CMD or terminal )Navigate to this folder. Use the "cd" command. 
	5. (Using CMD or terminal ) Run the pil_test.py script. 
		1. If you see a black canvas showing up, congrats!

## Step 3: Install Maya 


1. Download and install Autodesk Maya 2023. If you have Maya installed, please make sure it is at least Maya 2022 because version prior to 2020 supports python 2 instead of python 3.  
    - you can select the educational version by providing your user id. Make an autodesk account and [apply for the education license](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&page=1)
    - link to [maya](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=a_z&filters=individual#card-maya) after you have signed in. 
	2.  or you can download a 30-day free trial while you wait for your id to be approved. To download trial, [go to this link](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/free-trial?support=ADVANCED&plc=MAYA&term=1-YEAR&quantity=1)  You will need to select "business" in order to download. 
2.  Follow the installation instruction for Maya. Make sure you select the PyMel package 
	1. ![](../../../assets/w1/Pasted image 20220111152208.png)
3.Open Maya. 
	1. Create a new scene (you can save it where ever you want, this is for testing. )
	2.  By default you might see something like this 
	3. ![](../../../assets/w1/2022-01-13 11_16_59-Window.png)
4. In your PyCharm project, create a new python script called maya_test.py 
	1. ![](../../../assets/w1/Pasted image 20220113113727.png)
5. In maya_test.py, type the following lines:
	1. `import maya.cmds as cmds`
	2. `cmds.polySphere(n="mysphere")`
	3. Your file will look like
	4.  ![](../../../assets/w1/Pasted image 20220113113838.png)
6. Open the script panel. There are a couple of ways to open the script panel. You can check out [this link](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/Maya-Scripting/files/GUID-7C861047-C7E0-4780-ACB5-752CD22AB02E-htm.html) for alternative methods. We will show you one method here: 
	1. Look for the `Panel Layout Icon` ![](../../../assets/w1/2022-01-13 11_43_21-untitled_ - Autodesk MAYA 2022.1_ untitled.png). It's on the left side of your screen. 
	2. Right click the panel layout icon, select `edit layouts`
		1. ![](../../../assets/w1/2022-01-15 21_54_40-untitled - Autodesk MAYA 2022.1_ untitled.png)
	3. It will bring up the `Panel` popup window. Select  `layout`  and look for the `Script Editor/Persp` option. 
		3. ![](../../../assets/w1/2022-01-13 11_20_10-untitled - Autodesk MAYA 2022.1_ untitled.png)
	4. Your script editor will sit next to the perspective panel. 
		1. ![](../../../assets/w1/Pasted image 20220115215945.png)

7.  On the top left of the `script editor`,  click the `Source Script` icon
	1.  ![](../../../assets/w1/Pasted image 20220115220310.png)
8.  On the `Open Script` popup, navigate to the folder where you stored the `maya_test.py` and select the file `maya_test.py`. 
	1. ![](../../../assets/w1/Pasted image 20220115220503.png)
9. Once you clicked `open`, you should see the content of the `maya_test.py` appearing on the top part of your editor. 
	1. ![](../../../assets/w1/Pasted image 20220115220610.png)
	2. Also, your perspective view should have a sphere.
